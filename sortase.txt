AB  - Sortase A, a transpeptidase enzyme is present in many Gram-positive bacteria and 
      helps in the recruitment of the cell surface proteins. Over the last two decades, 
      Sortase A has become an attractive tool for performing in vivo and in vitro 
      ligations. Sortase A-mediated ligation has continuously been used for its 
      specificity, robustness, and highly efficient nature. These properties make it a 
      popular choice among protein engineers as well as researchers from different fields. 
      In this review, we give an overview of Sortase A-mediated ligation of various 
      molecules on the cell surfaces, which can have diverse applications in 
      interdisciplinary fields.

LID - 10.3390/md18070359 [doi]
LID - 359
AB  - Seven alkaloidal compounds (2-8) and one polyketide (1) were isolated from a 
      semisolid rice culture of the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. F452. Structures 
      of the isolated compounds were elucidated based on spectroscopic data and 
      comparisons with previously reported data. The alkaloidal compounds (2-8) displayed 
      weak to moderate inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus-derived sortase 
      A (SrtA) without affecting cell viability. Aspermytin A (1) strongly inhibited SrtA 
      activity, with an IC(50) value of 146.0 μM, and significantly reduced bacterial 
      adherence to fibronectin-coated surfaces. The present results indicate that the 
      underlying mechanism of action of compound 1 is associated with the inhibition of 
      SrtA-mediated S. aureus adhesion to fibronectin, thus potentially serving as an SrtA 
      inhibitor.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is an enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of proteins to the cell 
      wall of Gram-positive bacterial membrane, preventing the spread of pathogenic 
      bacterial strains. Here, one class of oxadiazole compounds was distinguished as an 
      efficient inhibitor of SrtA via the "S. aureus Sortase A" substrate-based virtual 
      screening. The current study on 3D-QSAR was done by utilizing preparation of the 
      structure in the Schrödinger software suite and an assessment of 120 derivatives 
      with the crystal structure of 1,2,4-oxadiazole which was extracted from the PDB data 
      bank. The docking operation of the best compound in terms of pMIC (pMIC = 2.77) was 
      done to determine the drug likeliness and binding form of 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
      derivatives as antibiotics in the active site. Using the kNN-MFA way, seven models 
      of 3D-QSAR were created and amongst them, and one model was selected as the best. 
      The chosen model based on q (2) (pred_r (2)) and R (2) values related to the sixth 
      factor of PLS illustrates better and more acceptable external and internal 
      predictions. Values of crossvalidation (pred_r (2)), validation (q (2)), and F were 
      observed 0.5479, 0.6319, and 179.0, respectively, for a test group including 24 
      molecules and the training group including 96 molecules. The external reliability 
      outcomes showed that the acceptable and the selective 3D-QSAR model had a high 
      predictive potential (R (2) = 0.9235) which was confirmed by the Y-randomization 
      test. Besides, the model applicability domain was described successfully to validate 
      the estimation of the model.

LID - 10.1007/s12275-019-8545-5 [doi]
AB  - Sortases are cysteine transpeptidases that assemble surface proteins and pili in 
      their cell envelope. Encoded by all Gram-positive bacteria, few Gram-negative 
      bacteria and archaea, sortases are currently divided into six classes (A-F). Due to 
      the steep increase in bacterial genome data in recent years, the number of sortase 
      homologues have also escalated rapidly. In this study, we used protein sequence 
      similarity networks to explore the taxonomic diversity of sortases and also to 
      evaluate the current classification of these enzymes. The resultant data suggest 
      that sortase classes A, B, and D predominate in Firmicutes and classes E and F are 
      enriched in Actinobacteria, whereas class C is distributed in both Firmicutes and 
      Actinobacteria except Streptomyces family. Sortases were also observed in various 
      Gram-negatives and euryarchaeota, which should be recognized as novel classes of 
      sortases. Motif analysis around the catalytic cysteine was also performed and 
      suggested that the residue at 2(nd) position from cysteine may help distinguish 
      various sortase classes. Moreover, the sequence analysis indicated that the 
      catalytic arginine is highly conserved in almost all classes except sortase F in 
      which arginine is replaced by asparagine in Actinobacteria. Additionally, class A 
      sortases showed higher structural variation as compared to other sortases, whereas 
      inter-class comparisons suggested structures of class C and D2 exhibited best 
      similarities. A better understanding of the residues highlighted in this study 
      should be helpful in elucidating their roles in substrate binding and the sortase 
      function, and successively could help in the development of strong sortase 
      inhibitors.

TI  - Stability Enhancement of a Dimeric HER2-Specific Affibody Molecule through Sortase 
      A-Catalyzed Head-to-Tail Cyclization.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26102874 [doi]
LID - 2874
AB  - Natural backbone-cyclized proteins have an increased thermostability and resistance 
      towards proteases, characteristics that have sparked interest in head-to-tail 
      cyclization as a method to stability-enhance proteins used in diagnostics and 
      therapeutic applications, for example. In this proof-of principle study, we have 
      produced and investigated a head-to-tail cyclized and HER2-specific Z(HER2:342) 
      Affibody dimer. The sortase A-mediated cyclization reaction is highly efficient 
      (>95%) under optimized conditions, and renders a cyclic Z(HER3:342)-dimer with an 
      apparent melting temperature, T(m), of 68 °C, which is 3 °C higher than that of its 
      linear counterpart. Circular dichroism spectra of the linear and cyclic dimers 
      looked very similar in the far-UV range, both before and after thermal unfolding to 
      90 °C, which suggests that cyclization does not negatively impact the helicity or 
      folding of the cyclic protein. The cyclic dimer had an apparent sub-nanomolar 
      affinity (K(d) ~750 pM) to the HER2-receptor, which is a ~150-fold reduction in 
      affinity relative to the linear dimer (K(d) ~5 pM), but the anti-HER2 Affibody dimer 
      remained a high-affinity binder even after cyclization. No apparent difference in 
      proteolytic stability was detected in an endopeptidase degradation assay for the 
      cyclic and linear dimers. In contrast, in an exopeptidase degradation assay, the 
      linear dimer was shown to be completely degraded after 5 min, while the cyclic dimer 
      showed no detectable degradation even after 60 min. We further demonstrate that a 
      site-specifically DyLight 594-labeled cyclic dimer shows specific binding to 
      HER2-overexpressing cells. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate 
      that head-to-tail cyclization can be an effective strategy to increase the stability 
      of an Affibody dimer.

TI  - Sortase A Mediated Bioconjugation of Common Epitopes Decreases Biofilm Formation in 
      Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most notorious pathogens and is frequently 
      associated with nosocomial infections imposing serious risk to immune-compromised 
      patients. This is in part due to its ability to colonize at the surface of 
      indwelling medical devices and biofilm formation. Combating the biofilm formation 
      with antibiotics has its own challenges like higher values of minimum inhibitory 
      concentrations. Here, we describe a new approach to target biofilm formation by Gram 
      positive bacteria. Sortase A is a transpeptidase enzyme which is responsible for 
      tagging of around ∼22 cell surface proteins onto the outer surface. These proteins 
      play a major role in the bacterial virulence. Sortase A recognizes its substrate 
      through LPXTG motif. Here, we use this approach to install the synthetic peptide 
      substrates onS. aureus. Sortase A substrate mimic, 6His-LPETG peptide was 
      synthesized using solid phase peptide chemistry. Incorporation of the peptide on the 
      cell surface was measured using ELISA. Effect of peptide incubation on 
      Staphylococcus aureus biofilm was also studied. 71.1% biofilm inhibition was 
      observed with 100 μM peptide while on silicon coated rubber latex catheter, 45.82% 
      inhibition was observed. The present work demonstrates the inability of surface 
      modified S. aureus to establish biofilm formation thereby presenting a novel method 
      for attenuating its virulence.

TI  - Sortase A-Inhibitory Coumarins from the Folk Medicinal Plant Poncirus trifoliata.
PG  - 3004-3011
LID - 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00551 [doi]
AB  - Thirteen coumarins (1-13), including five new compounds (1-5), were isolated from 
      the folk medicinal plant Poncirus trifoliata. Combined spectroscopic analyses 
      revealed that coumarins 1-4 are bis-isoprenylated coumarins with diverse oxidation 
      patterns, while 5 is an enantiomeric di-isoprenylated coumarin. The absolute 
      configurations of the stereogenic centers in the isoprenyl chains were assigned 
      through MTPA and MPA methods, and those of the known compounds triphasiol (6) and 
      ponciol (7) were also assigned using similar methods. These coumarins inhibited 
      significantly Staphylococcus aureus-derived sortase A (SrtA), a transpeptidase 
      responsible for anchoring surface proteins to the peptidoglycan cell wall in 
      Gram-positive bacteria. The present results obtained indicated that the bioactivity 
      and underlying mechanism of action of these coumarins are associated with the 
      inhibition of SrtA-mediated S. aureus adhesion to eukaryotic cell matrix proteins 
      including fibrinogen and fibronectin, thus potentially serving as SrtA inhibitors.

AB  - Sortase-mediated ligation (sortagging) is commonly performed using the 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) that strictly recognizes the N-terminal 
      glycine residue. In this work, a rational design of Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A 
      (SpSrtA) for improved transpeptidase activity toward different N-terminal amino acid 
      residues was conducted. The generated variant SpSrtA M3 (E189H/V206I/E215A) showed 
      up to 6.6-fold (vs SpSrtA wild-type) enhanced catalytic efficiency. Additionally, M3 
      retains the specificity toward N-terminal alanine, glycine, serine residues, as well 
      as branched (at α-carbon) primary amines as wild-type parent. Furthermore, M3 was 
      applied for head-to-tail backbone cyclization of proteins.

TI  - Sortase A-mediated crosslinked short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases as novel 
      biocatalysts with improved thermostability and catalytic efficiency.
PG  - 3081

AB  - (S)-carbonyl reductase II (SCRII) from Candida parapsilosis is a short-chain alcohol 
      dehydrogenase/reductase. It catalyses the conversion of 2-hydroxyacetophenone to 
      (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol with low efficiency. Sortase was reported as a molecular 
      "stapler" for site-specific protein conjugation to strengthen or add protein 
      functionality. Here, we describe Staphylococcus aureus sortase A-mediated 
      crosslinking of SCRII to produce stable catalysts for efficient biotransformation. 
      Via a native N-terminal glycine and an added GGGGSLPETGG peptide at C-terminus of 
      SCRII, SCRII subunits were conjugated by sortase A to form crosslinked SCRII, mainly 
      dimers and trimers. The crosslinked SCRII showed over 6-fold and 4-fold increases, 
      respectively, in activity and k (cat)/K (m) values toward 2-hydroxyacetophenone 
      compared with wild-type SCRII. Moreover, crosslinked SCRII was much more 
      thermostable with its denaturation temperature (T(m)) increased to 60 °C. 
      Biotransformation result showed that crosslinked SCRII gave a product optical purity 
      of 100% and a yield of >99.9% within 3 h, a 16-fold decrease in transformation 
      duration with respect to Escherichia coli/pET-SCRII. Sortase A-catalysed ligation 
      also obviously improved T(m)s and product yields of eight other short-chain alcohol 
      dehydrogenases/reductases. This work demonstrates a generic technology to improve 
      enzyme function and thermostability through sortase A-mediated crosslinking of 
      oxidoreductases.

TI  - Prospecting Potential Inhibitors of Sortase A from Enterococcus faecalis: A 
      Multidrug Resistant Bacteria, through In-silico and In-vitro Approaches.
PG  - 582-592
LID - 10.2174/0929866527666191227143048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) infections are becoming dreadfully common in 
      hospital environments. Infections caused by Ef are difficult to treat because of its 
      acquired resistance to different class of antibiotics, making it a multidrug 
      resistant bacteria. Key pathogenic factor of Ef includes its ability to form biofilm 
      on the surface of diagnostic and other medical devices. Sortase A (SrtA) is a 
      cysteine transpeptidase which plays a pivotal role in the formation of biofilm in 
      Ef, hence, it is considered as an important enzyme for the pathogenesis of Ef. Thus, 
      inhibition of (SrtA) will affect biofilm formation, which will reduce its virulence 
      and eventually Ef infection will be abridged. OBJECTIVE: To find potential 
      inhibitors of Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA) through insilico and in-vitro 
      methods. METHODS: Gene coding for EfSrtA was cloned, expressed and purified. 
      Three-dimensional model of EfSrtA was created using Swiss-Model workspace. In-silico 
      docking studies using Autodock vina and molecular dynamics simulations of the 
      modelled structures using Gromacs platform were performed to explore potential lead 
      compounds against EfSrtA. In-vitro binding experiments using spectrofluorometric 
      technique was carried out to confirm and validate the study. RESULTS: In-silico 
      docking and in-vitro binding experiments revealed that curcumin, berberine and 
      myricetin bound to EfSrtA at nanomolar concentrations with high affinity. 
      CONCLUSION: This is a first structural report of EfSrtA with curcumin, berberine and 
      myricetin. Taking in account the herbal nature of these compounds, the use of these 
      compounds as inhibitors will be advantageous. This study validated curcumin, 
      berberine and myricetin as potential inhibitors of EfSrtA.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) is widely used for site-specific protein 
      modifications, but it lacks the robustness for performing bioconjugation reactions 
      at elevated temperatures or in presence of denaturing agents. Loop engineering and 
      subsequent head-to-tail backbone cyclization of SaSrtA yielded the cyclized variant 
      CyM6 that has a 7.5 °C increased melting temperature and up to 4.6-fold increased 
      resistance towards denaturants when compared to the parent rM4. CyM6 gained up to 
      2.6-fold (vs. parent rM4) yield of conjugate in ligation of peptide and primary 
      amine under denaturing conditions.

TI  - Long-Acting Human Interleukin 2 Bioconjugate Modified with Fatty Acids by Sortase A.
PG  - 615-625
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00062 [doi]
AB  - Human Interleukin 2 (IL-2) has already achieved impressive results as a therapeutic 
      agent for cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, one of the limitations associated 
      with the clinical application of IL-2 is its short half-life owing to rapid 
      clearance by the kidneys. Modification with fatty acids, as an albumin noncovalent 
      ligand with the advantage of deep penetration into tissues and high activity-to-mass 
      ratio, is a commonly used approach to improve the half-life of native peptides and 
      proteins. In this investigation, we attempted to extend the half-life of IL-2 
      through conjugation with a fatty acid using sortase A (srtA). We initially designed 
      and optimized three IL-2 analogues with different peptide linkers between the 
      C-terminus of IL-2 and srtA recognition sequence (LPETG). Among these, analogue A3 
      was validated as the optimal IL-2 analogue for further modification. Next, six fatty 
      acid moieties with the same fatty acid and different hydrophilic spacers were 
      conjugated to A3 through srtA. The six bioconjugates generated were screened for in 
      vitro biological activity, among which bioconjugate B6 was identified as 
      near-optimal to IL-2. Additionally, B6 could effectively bind albumin through the 
      conjugated fatty acid, which contributed to a significant improvement in its 
      pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. In summary, we have developed a novel IL-2 
      bioconjugate, B6, modified with fatty acids using srtA, which may effectively serve 
      as a new-generation long-acting IL-2 immunotherapeutic agent.

AB  - Sortases are transpeptidases produced by Gram-positive bacteria to anchor cell 
      surface proteins covalently to the cell wall. The Staphylococcus aureus sortase A 
      (SrtA) cleaves a short C-terminal recognition motif (LPXTG) on the target protein 
      followed by the formation of an amide bond with the pentaglycine cross-bridge in the 
      cell wall. Over recent years, several researchers have exploited this specific 
      reaction for a range of biotechnology applications, including the incorporation of 
      non-native peptides and non-peptidic molecules into proteins, the generation of 
      nucleic acid-peptide conjugates and neoglycoconjugates, protein circularisation, and 
      labelling of cell surface proteins on living cells.

TI  - In-Silico Identified New Natural Sortase A Inhibitors Disrupt S. aureus Biofilm 
      Formation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21228601 [doi]
LID - 8601
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a membrane-associated enzyme that anchors surface-exposed 
      proteins to the cell wall envelope of Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus 
      aureus. As SrtA is essential for Gram-positive bacterial pathogenesis but 
      dispensable for microbial growth or viability, SrtA is considered a favorable target 
      for the enhancement of novel anti-infective drugs that aim to interfere with key 
      bacterial virulence mechanisms, such as biofilm formation, without developing drug 
      resistance. Here, we used virtual screening to search an in-house natural compound 
      library and identified two natural compounds, N1287 (Skyrin) and N2576 
      ((4,5-dichloro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-[2,4-dihydroxy-3-(4-methyl-pentyl)-phenyl]-methanone) 
      that inhibited the enzymatic activity of SrtA. These compounds also significantly 
      reduced the growth of S. aureus but possessed moderate mammalian toxicity. 
      Furthermore, S. aureus strains treated with these compounds exhibited reduction in 
      adherence to host fibrinogen, as well as biofilm formation. Hence, these compounds 
      may represent an anti-infective therapy without the side effects of antibiotics.

TI  - Preparation of Site-Specific Cytotoxic Protein Conjugates via Maleimide-thiol 
      Chemistry and Sortase A-Mediated Ligation.
LID - 10.3791/61918 [doi]
AB  - Cancer is currently the second most common cause of death worldwide. The hallmark of 
      cancer cells is the presence of specific marker proteins such as growth factor 
      receptors on their surface. This feature enables development of highly selective 
      therapeutics, the protein bioconjugates, composed of targeting proteins (antibodies 
      or receptor ligands) connected to highly cytotoxic drugs by a specific linker. Due 
      to very high affinity and selectivity of targeting proteins the bioconjugates 
      recognize marker proteins on the cancer cells surface and utilize receptor-mediated 
      endocytosis to reach the cell interior. Intracellular vesicular transport system 
      ultimately delivers the bioconjugates to the lysosomes, where proteolysis separates 
      free cytotoxic drugs from the proteinaceous core of the bioconjugates, triggering 
      drug-dependent cancer cell death. Currently, there are several protein bioconjugates 
      approved for cancer treatment and large number is under development or clinical 
      trials. One of the main challenges in the generation of the bioconjugates is a 
      site-specific attachment of the cytotoxic drug to the targeting protein. Recent 
      years have brought a tremendous progress in the development of chemical and 
      enzymatic strategies for protein modification with cytotoxic drugs. Here we present 
      the detailed protocols for the site-specific incorporation of cytotoxic warheads 
      into targeting proteins using a chemical method employing maleimide-thiol chemistry 
      and an enzymatic approach that relies on sortase A-mediated ligation. We use 
      engineered variant of fibroblast growth factor 2 and fragment crystallizable region 
      of human immunoglobulin G as an exemplary targeting proteins and monomethyl 
      auristatin E and methotrexate as model cytotoxic drugs. All the described strategies 
      allow for highly efficient generation of biologically active cytotoxic conjugates of 
      defined molecular architecture with potential for selective treatment of diverse 
      cancers.

TI  - Sortase A-mediated synthesis of ligand-grafted cyclized peptides for modulating a 
      model protein-protein interaction.
PG  - 1499-505
LID - 10.1002/biot.201500013 [doi]
AB  - Specific ligand-grafted cyclic peptides are promising drug candidates that can 
      modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with increased proteolytic stability. 
      In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that Sortase A (SrtA)-mediated peptide 
      transpeptidation can be applied to produce bioactive sequence-grafted, stable, 
      cyclic peptides. A naturally occurring cyclic peptide, sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 
      (SFTI-1), was selected as the scaffold, and a tetrapeptide motif, Glu-Ser-Asp-Val 
      (ESDV), was grafted into the scaffold as a model ligand. The linear precursor of the 
      grafted peptide with SrtA-recognition motifs at the N- and C-termini was cyclized in 
      good yield simply by co-incubation with SrtA. The ESDV-grafted cyclic SFTI-1 
      obtained was confirmed to have high stability against proteolysis by human serum and 
      bound to the target PDZ2 domain of postsynaptic density-95 protein. An optimized 
      sequence-grafted cyclic SFTI-1 could competitively suppress the interaction of PDZ2 
      with its natural ligand, the C-terminal peptide of the NR2B subunit of the 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. These results show that a strategy combining peptide 
      grafting into the SFTI-1 scaffold with SrtA-catalyzed cyclization can be a simple 
      and effective method for producing stable peptide drugs.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a cysteine transpeptidase of most gram-positive bacteria that is 
      responsible for the anchoring of many surface protein virulence factors to the cell 
      wall. SrtA ablation has demonstrated to alleviate the infection without affecting 
      the viability of bacteria. Herein, a series of benzofuran cyanide derivatives were 
      synthesized and evaluated. Several compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activity 
      against SrtA with IC(50) values from 3.3 μM to 21.8 μM compared with the known SrtA 
      inhibitor pHMB (IC(50) = 130 μM). Ⅲ-1, Ⅲ-15, Ⅲ-34 and V-1 showed potent inhibitory 
      effects on biofilm formation with IC(50) values from 2.1 μM to 54.2 μM. Invasion 
      assays showed the four compounds caused a decrease of 4%-24.0% in the uptake of the 
      S. aureus strain by 293T cells. Further assay showed that compound Ⅲ-15 decreased 
      the amount of cell wall-associated protein A by 26.5%. Structure-activity 
      relationship and docking studies demonstrated that the acrylonitrile moiety of the 
      compounds played an important role in enhancing the activity. When the double bond 
      of acrylonitrile changed to single bond, the activity was decreased significantly. 
      This indicates that acrylonitrile, which is a Michael receptor, can inhibit the 
      activity of SrtA by covalent binding effectively to the thiol group of Cys184.

TI  - Crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A: implications for sortase 
      mechanism.
PG  - 6924-33
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M805406200 [doi]
AB  - Sortases are a family of Gram-positive bacterial transpeptidases that anchor 
      secreted proteins to bacterial cell surfaces. These include many proteins that play 
      critical roles in the virulence of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens such that 
      sortases are attractive targets for development of novel antimicrobial agents. All 
      Gram-positive pathogens express a "housekeeping" sortase that recognizes the 
      majority of secreted proteins containing an LPXTG wall-sorting motif and covalently 
      attaches these to bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Many Gram-positive pathogens 
      also express additional sortases that link a small number of proteins, often with 
      variant wall-sorting motifs, to either other surface proteins or peptidoglycan. To 
      better understand the mechanisms of catalysis and substrate recognition by the 
      housekeeping sortase produced by the important human pathogen Streptococcus 
      pyogenes, the crystal structure of this protein has been solved and its 
      transpeptidase activity established in vitro. The structure reveals a novel 
      arrangement of key catalytic residues in the active site of a sortase, the first 
      that is consistent with kinetic analysis. The structure also provides a complete 
      description of residue positions surrounding the active site, overcoming the 
      limitation of localized disorder in previous structures of sortase A-type proteins. 
      Modification of the active site Cys through oxidation to its sulfenic acid form or 
      by an alkylating reagent supports a role for a reactive thiol/thiolate in the 
      catalytic mechanism. These new insights into sortase structure and function could 
      have important consequences for inhibitor design.

      faecalis.

AB  - Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) is a Gram positive multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterium 
      contributing about 70% of total enterococcal infections. In Ef, a membrane anchored 
      transpeptidase Sortase A plays a major role in biofilm formation. Therefore, it has 
      been recognized as an ideal drug target against Ef. In this regard to identify the 
      potential inhibitors of Ef Sortase A (EfSrtA(∆59)), we have cloned, expressed and 
      purified EfSrtA(∆59). We have also done the in-silico docking studies to identify 
      lead molecules interacting with EfSrtA(∆59). Furthermore, the binding studies of 
      these identified lead molecules were performed with EfSrtA(∆59) using fluorescence 
      and CD spectroscopic studies. We also identified the interaction partner of 
      EfSrtA(∆59) using STRING. Protein-protein docking studies were also performed. 
      Docking experiment revealed that benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, pantoprazole and 
      valsartan were bound to same site on the protein with similar interactions. Binding 
      studies using fluorescence spectroscopic studies confirmed the binding of all the 
      ligands to EfSrtA(∆59), which was further validated by far and near-UV CD 
      experiments. Thermo stability experiments validate the stability-activity trade-off 
      hypothesis. Sequence based interaction studies identified that EfSrtA(∆59) interact 
      with the Ef_1091, Ef_1093 and Ef_2658 proteins. Homology model of Ef_1091 and 
      Ef_1093 was docked with modeled EfSrtA(∆59) and their interactions are also 
      discussed.

TI  - Streptococcus suis sortase A is Ca2+ independent and is inhibited by acteoside,

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) has long been recognized as an ideal drug target for therapeutic 
      agents against Gram-positive pathogens. However, the SrtA of Streptococcus suis 
      (Ss-SrtA), an important zoonotic agent, has not been studied. In this study, the 
      enzymatic properties of Ss-SrtA were investigated, and inhibition of Ss-SrtA by 
      natural products was evaluated. Ss-SrtA was expressed and purified. The purified 
      recombinant Ss-SrtA had maximal activity at pH 6.0-7.5, 45°C, and showed a Km of 6.7 
      μM for the hydrolysis of substrate abz-LPATG-dnp. Different from Staphylococcus 
      aureus SrtA (Sa-SrtA) which is stimulated by Ca2+, Ss-SrtA was observed to be Ca2+ 
      independent. Structural analysis showed that salt bridges formed between K111 and 
      D180 in Ss-SrtA replaced the function of Ca2+ in Sa-SrtA to stabilize the 
      substrate-binding cleft. Site-directed mutagenesis identified H126, C192 and R200 as 
      the key residues of Ss-SrtA active site. To discover potential inhibitors, the 
      percent inhibition of sortase activity by natural products was measured. Among these 
      selected natural products, acteoside, isoquercitrin and baicalin were discovered as 
      novel SrtA inhibitors, with IC50 values of 36.3 ± 1.3 μM, 100.0 ± 1.3 μM and 85.4 ± 
      1.5 μM, respectively. The inhibitory effects of these three natural products were 
      further confirmed on endogenous Sa-SrtA. Using a previously established S. aureus 
      model with a fluorescent-labeled Sa-SrtA substrate, acteoside, isoquercitrin, and 
      baicalin showed 86%, 28% and 45% inhibition on endogenous Sa-SrtA activity, 
      respectively. Overall, these findings shed new light on enzymatic properties, 
      Ca2+-independent catalytic mechanism and potential inhibitors of Ss-SrtA.

AB  - Three flavonoids were isolated from dried flowers of Sophora japonica using 
      repetitive column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The 
      flavonoids were identified as rutin (1), 
      quercetin-3'-O-methyl-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1 → 6)-β-D-glucopyranoside (2), and 
      quercetin (3) on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and comparison of values 
      reported in the literature. These compounds inhibited the action of sortase A (SrtA) 
      from Streptococcus mutans, a primary etiologic agent of human dental caries. The 
      onset and magnitude of inhibition of saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutans treated 
      with compound 1 was comparable to that of untreated S. mutans with a deletion of the 
      srtA gene.

AB  - In order to achieve efficient extracellular expression of Sortase A (SrtA), various 
      strategies in Pichia pastoris system were applied in this study. Among different 
      constructed recombinant strains, the SMD1168 strain integrated 5.7 copies of srtA 
      gene under control of AOX1 promoter was proved to be the best strain for the 
      extracellular SrtA expression. After the optimization of fermentation conditions 
      (induction 72 h at 28 °C, initial pH 6.0, supplemented with 1.5% methanol), the 
      highest yield and activity of extracellular SrtA reached 97.8 mg/L and 131.9 U/mL at 
      the shake-flask level, respectively. This is the first report on the efficient 
      secretory expression of SrtA in P. pastoris and the yield of SrtA is the maximum 
      compared with previous reports. In addition, the transpeptidation activity of 
      extracellular SrtA was confirmed by the successful immobilization of enhanced green 
      fluorescent protein (EGFP) onto Gly(3)-polystyrene beads.

AB  - Chitosan macro-particles prepared by the neutralization method were applied to 
      Sortase A (SrtA) immobilization using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinking agent. The 
      particles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed 
      to optimize the immobilization process. An average specific activity of 3142 U (mg 
      protein)(-1) was obtained under optimized immobilization conditions (chitosan 
      concentration 3%, SrtA concentration 0.5 mg·mL(-1), glutaraldehyde concentration 
      0.5%, crosslinking and immobilization at 20 °C, crosslinking for 3 h, and an 
      immobilization time of 8 h). The transpeptidase activity of immobilized SrtA was 
      proved by a peptide-to-peptide ligation with a conversion yield approximately at 
      80%, and the immobilized catalyst was successfully reused for five cycles without 
      obvious activity loss. Moreover, the scale-up capability of using immobilized SrtA 
      to catalyze a head-to-tail peptide cyclization was investigated in a batch reaction 
      and the conversion yield was more than 95% when using 20 mg of peptide as a

AB  - Three new lignans (3, 4, and 6) along with eight known lignans and phenyl propanoids 
      were isolated from the dried roots of Pulsatilla koreana, an oriental folk medicine. 
      Based upon the results of combined spectroscopic and chemical methods, the 
      structures of new compounds were determined to be lignan glycosides. Included among 
      the known compounds are three compounds (5, 7, and 8) isolated first time from this 
      plant as well as two compounds (2 and 11) previously reported only as synthetic 
      derivatives. These compounds significantly inhibited the action of Sortase A from 
      Streptococcus mutans OMZ65, an isolate from human oral cavity.

TI  - A noncanonical function of sortase enables site-specific conjugation of small 
      molecules to lysine residues in proteins.
PG  - 441-5
LID - 10.1002/anie.201408126 [doi]
AB  - We provide the first demonstration that isopeptide ligation, a noncanonical activity 
      of the enzyme sortase A, can be used to modify recombinant proteins. This reaction 
      was used in vitro to conjugate small molecules to a peptide, an engineered targeting 
      protein, and a full-length monoclonal antibody with an exquisite level of control 
      over the site of conjugation. Attachment to the protein substrate occurred 
      exclusively through isopeptide bonds at a lysine ε-amino group within a specific 
      amino acid sequence. This reaction allows more than one molecule to be 
      site-specifically conjugated to a protein at internal sites, thereby overcoming 
      significant limitations of the canonical native peptide ligation reaction catalyzed 
      by sortase A. Our method provides a unique chemical ligation procedure that is 
      orthogonal to existing methods, supplying a new method to site-specifically modify 
      lysine residues that will be a valuable addition to the protein conjugation toolbox.

AB  - Streptavidin is tetrameric protein which has tight and specific biotin binding 
      affinity, and streptavidin modification of proteins or small molecules is widely 
      used for biotechnology tool. Here, we demonstrate site-specific streptavidin-protein 
      conjugation using enzymes. We focused on sortase A, a transpeptidase from 
      Staphylococcus aureus. A streptavidin-tagged LPETG motif (Stav-LPETG) was expressed 
      in Escherichia coli. We achieved soluble streptavidin expression in E. coli without 
      refolding using a cold shock expression system. Then we successfully conjugated 
      Stav-LPETG with pentaglycine-appended green fluorescence protein (Gly5-GFP) or 
      triglycine-appended glucose oxidase (Gly3-GOD) using sortase A. SDS-PAGE analysis 
      showed site-specific tetrameric streptavidin-protein conjugation with the tagged 
      proteins. In addition, the functions of a Stav-GOD conjugate, i.e., biotin-binding 
      and glucose oxidase activity, were significantly higher compared to those of 
      streptavidin-GOD conjugates prepared by chemical modification.

AB  - Isocadiolides A-H (1-8) and cadiolide N (9), new polybrominated aromatic compounds, 
      were isolated from a Korean Synoicum sp. ascidian. On the basis of the results of 
      extensive spectroscopic analyses, these compounds possessed tris-bromohydroxyphenyl 
      moieties as a common structural motif, while their cores varied [cyclopentenedione 
      (1-5), dihydrofuran (6 and 7), pyranone (8), and furanone (9)], reflecting different 
      extents of rearrangement and oxidation. Several of these compounds exhibited weak 
      antibacterial activities and moderate abilities to inhibit the microbial enzymes 
      sortase A and isocitrate lyase.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA), a type of transpeptidase responsible for anchoring surface 
      proteins to the peptidoglycan cell wall, is important in the virulence of 
      gram-positive bacteria. Three compounds were isolated from marine-derived 
      Streptomyces sp. MBTH32 using various chromatography techniques. The structures of 
      these compounds were determined based on spectroscopic data and comparisons with 
      previously reported data. Among the metabolites tested, lumichrome showed strong 
      inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus SrtA without affecting cell 
      viability. The results of cell clumping activity assessment suggest the potential 
      for using this compound to treat S. aureus infection by inhibiting SrtA activity.

AB  - Six new bis(indole) alkaloids (1-6) along with eight known ones of the topsentin 
      class were isolated from a Spongosorites sp. sponge of Korea. Based on the results 
      of combined spectroscopic analyses, the structures of spongosoritins A-D (1-4) were 
      determined to possess a 2-methoxy-1-imidazole-5-one core connecting the indole 
      moieties, and these were linked by a linear urea bridge for spongocarbamides A (5) 
      and B (6). The absolute configurations of spongosoritins were assigned by electronic 
      circular dichroism (ECD) computation. The new compounds exhibited moderate 
      inhibition against transpeptidase sortase A and weak inhibition against human 
      pathogenic bacteria and A549 and K562 cancer cell lines.

      Staphylococcal aureus.
PG  - 6533-43
LID - 10.3390/molecules20046533 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a cysteine transpeptidase of most Gram-positive bacteria that is 
      responsible for the anchorage of many surface protein virulence factors to the cell 
      wall layer. SrtA mutants are unable to display surface proteins and are defective in 
      the establishment of infections without affecting microbial viability. In this 
      study, we report that quercitrin (QEN), a natural compound that does not affect 
      Staphylococcus aureus growth, can inhibit the catalytic activity of SrtA in 
      fibrinogen (Fg) cell-clumping and immobilized fibronectin (Fn) adhesion assays. 
      Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays suggest that QEN binds to the 
      binding sites of the SrtA G167A and V193A mutants. These findings indicate that QEN 
      is a potential lead compound for the development of new anti-virulence agents 
      against S. aureus infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sortase A (SrtA) is a transpeptidase found in Staphylococcus aureus, 
      which is widely used in site-specific protein modification. However, SrtA was 
      expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) in rather low level (ranging from several 
      milligrams to 76.9 mg/L at most). The present study aims to optimize fermentation 
      conditions for improving SrtA expression in E. coli. RESULTS: Under the optimized 
      media (0.48 g/L glycerol, 1.37 g/L tryptone, 0.51 g/L yeast extract, MOPS 0.5 g/L, 
      PBS buffer 180 mL/L) and condition (30 °C for 8 h) in a 7-L fermentor, the enzyme 
      activity and the yield of SrtA reached 2458.4 ± 115.9 U/mg DCW and 
      232.4 ± 21.1 mg/L, respectively, which were higher by 5.8- and 4.5-folds compared 
      with initial conditions, respectively. The yield of SrtA also represented threefold 
      increase than the previously reported maximal level. In addition, the enzymatic 
      characterizations of SrtA (optimal temperature, optimal pH, the influence of metal 
      irons, and tolerance to water-soluble organic solvents) were determined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced expression of SrtA was achieved by optimization of medium and 
      condition. This result will have potential application for production levels of SrtA 
      on an industry scale. Moreover, the detailed enzymatic characterizations of SrtA 
      were examined, which will provide a useful guide for its future application.

TI  - Sortase-Mediated High-Throughput Screening Platform for Directed Enzyme Evolution.
PG  - 203-211
LID - 10.1021/acscombsci.7b00153 [doi]
AB  - Sortase-catalyzed ligations have emerged as powerful tools for the site-specific 
      ligation of peptides and proteins in material science and biocatalysis. In this 
      work, a directed sortase evolution strategy (SortEvolve) has been developed as a 
      general high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to improve activity of sortase A 
      (application 1) and to perform directed laccase evolution through a semipurification 
      process in 96-well microtiter plate (MTP) (application 2). A semipurification 
      process in polypropylene MTP (PP-MTP) is achieved through the anchor peptide LCI, 
      which acts as adhesion promoter. To validate the SortEvolve screening platform for 
      both applications, three site-saturation mutagenesis (SSM) libraries of sortase A 
      (Sa-SrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus (application 1) and two SSM libraries of the 
      copper efflux oxidase (CueO laccase) from Escherichia coli (application 2) were 
      generated at literature reported positions. After screening and rescreening, an 
      array of Sa-SrtA variants (including the previously reported P94S, D160N, and D165A) 
      and CueO variants (including the previously reported D439A and P444A) were 
      identified. Further recombinant Sa-SrtA variant P94T/D160L/D165Q and CueO variant 
      D439V/P444V were characterized with 22-fold and 103-fold improvements in catalytic 
      efficiency compared with corresponding wild-types, respectively. An important 
      advantage of the SortEvolve screening platform in comparison to many MTP-based 
      screening systems is that the background noise was minimized (decreased 20-fold; 
      application 2) due to the employed semipurification process. In essence, SortEvolve 
      provides a universal surface-functionalized screening platform for sortases and 
      enzymes in which especially background activity can be minimized to enable 
      successful directed evolution campaigns.

AB  - A Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase, sortase A (SrtA), which catalyzes a peptide 
      ligation with high substrate specificity, is a useful tool to site-specifically 
      attach proteinaceous/peptidic functional molecules to target proteins. However, its 
      strong Ca(2+) dependency makes SrtA difficult for use under low Ca(2+) 
      concentrations and in the presence of Ca(2+)-binding substances. To overcome this 
      problem, we designed a SrtA mutant that Ca(2+)-independently demonstrates a high 
      catalytic activity. The heptamutant (P94R/E105K/E108A/D160N/D165A/K190E/K196T), 
      which resulted from a combination of known mutations at the Ca(2+) -binding site and 
      around the substrate-binding site, successfully catalyzed a selective 
      protein-protein ligation in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Selective protein 
      modification in living cells is a promising approach for investigating cellular 
      events and regulating cell functions. This SrtA mutant may prove to be a versatile 
      tool for adding new functionalities to proteins of interest by incorporating 
      functional proteins and chemically modified peptides in living cells, which usually 
      retain low Ca(2+) concentrations.

AB  - Sortases are a family of Gram-positive transpeptidases responsible for anchoring 
      surface protein virulence factors to the peptidoglycan cell wall layer. In 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), deletion of sortase isoform results in a 
      significant reduction in virulence and infection potential. Twenty flavonoids were 
      isolated from the stem of the folk medicinal plant Spatholobus suberectus Dunn. 
      These compounds were tested against S. aureus-derived sortase A (SrtA), a key 
      transpeptidase for bacterial virulence. Among these active flavonoids, 
      7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-flavanone (3) and formononetin (10) were identified as compounds 
      with promising SrtA inhibitory activity. These compounds also exhibited inhibitory 
      activity against S. aureus cell clumping to fibrinogen. The suppression of 
      cell-clumping activity indicates the potential of these compounds in the treatment 
      of S. aureus infections via the inhibition of SrtA.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a transpeptidase widely used to site-specifically modify 
      peptides and proteins and shows promise for industrial applications. In this study, 
      a novel strategy was developed for constructing immobilized-SrtA as a robust and 
      recyclable enzyme via direct immobilization of extracellularly expressed SrtA in the 
      fermentation supernatant using magnetic particles. Efficient extracellular SrtA 
      expression was achieved in Escherichia coli through molecular engineering, including 
      manipulation of the protein transport pathway, codon optimization, and co-expression 
      of molecular chaperones to promote expressed SrtA secretion into the medium at high 
      levels. Subsequently, a simple one-step protocol was established for the 
      purification and immobilization of SrtA containing a His-tag from the fermentation 
      supernatant onto a nickel-modified magnetic particle. The immobilized SrtA was 
      proved to retain full enzymatic activity for peptide-to-peptide ligation and protein 
      modification, and was successfully reused for five cycles without obvious activity 
      loss.

AB  - A new maltol derivative (2) along with three known maltol derivative (1) and 
      flavonol glycosides (3 and 4) were isolated from the dried flowers of Sophora 
      japonica. Based upon the results of combined spectroscopic methods, the structure of 
      new compound (2) was determined to be 
      maltol-3-O-(4'-O-cis-p-coumaroyl-6'-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaroyl))-β-glucopyranoside, 
      an isomer of 1. These compounds strongly inhibited the action of sortase A (SrtA) 
      from Streptococcus mutans, a primary etiologic agent of human dental caries. The 
      onset and magnitude of inhibition of the saliva-induced aggregation in S. mutans 
      treated with compound 2 (4×IC50) were comparable to the behavior of untreated 
      srtA-deletion mutant.

AB  - Targeted delivery or "smart delivery" of pharmaceutical or imaging agents and even 
      entire cells such as stem cells is an emerging trend in modern biotechnology. A 
      binding ligand such as an antibody that can specifically bind to receptors expressed 
      at a disease site is an essential component of such constructs. Different chemical 
      methods have been widely used to apply antibodies for delivery systems; however, 
      they typically result in impairment or loss of antibody functionality. 
      Enzyme-mediated conjugation approaches have been developed to overcome this major 
      disadvantage of conventional chemical methods. Sortase, an enzyme derived from 
      Staphylococcus aureus, is able to provide a biochemically robust, highly 
      reproducible, and site-specific coupling method for the conjugation of antibodies to 
      pharmaceutical agents, nanoparticles, and cells for drug delivery, molecular 
      imaging, and cell homing. Here, we review the use of sortase and other enzyme-based 
      methods as bioconjugation tools with a focus on cardiovascular applications.

TI  - Conversion of an amide to a high-energy thioester by Staphylococcus aureus sortase A 
      is powered by variable binding affinity for calcium.

AB  - Thioesters are key intermediates in biology, which often are generated from less 
      energy-rich amide precursors. Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) is an enzyme 
      widely used in biotechnology for peptide ligation. The reaction proceeds in two 
      steps, where the first step involves the conversion of an amide bond of substrate 
      peptide into a thioester intermediate with the enzyme. Here we show that the free 
      energy required for this step is matched by an about 30-fold increase in binding 
      affinity of a calcium ion at the calcium binding site of SrtA, which is remote from 
      the thioester bond. The magnitude of this allosteric effect highlights the 
      importance of calcium for the activity of SrtA. The increase in calcium binding 
      affinity upon binding of substrate not only achieves catalytic formation of an 
      energy-rich intermediate in the absence of nucleotide triphosphates or any tight 
      non-covalent enzyme-substrate interactions, but is also accompanied by accumulation 
      of the labile thioester intermediate, which makes it directly observable in nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.

TI  - Sortase-Mediated Ligation of Purely Artificial Building Blocks.
LID - 10.3390/polym10020151 [doi]
LID - 151
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus has been often used for ligating a 
      protein with other natural or synthetic compounds in recent years. Here we show that 
      SrtA-mediated ligation (SML) is universally applicable for the linkage of two purely 
      artificial building blocks. Silica nanoparticles (NPs), poly(ethylene glycol) and 
      poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) are chosen as synthetic building blocks. As a proof of 
      concept, NP⁻polymer, NP⁻NP, and polymer⁻polymer structures are formed by SrtA 
      catalysis. Therefore, the building blocks are equipped with the recognition sequence 
      needed for SrtA reaction-the conserved peptide LPETG-and a pentaglycine motif. The 
      successful formation of the reaction products is shown by means of transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of 
      flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The 
      sortase catalyzed linkage of artificial building blocks sets the stage for the 
      development of a new approach to link synthetic structures in cases where their 
      synthesis by established chemical methods is complicated.

PG  - 1457-1460
LID - 10.4014/jmb.1704.04001 [doi]
AB  - Seven flavonoids were isolated from Spatholobus suberectus via repetitive column 
      chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The chemical structures 
      of these compounds were identified by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with 
      values reported in the literature. Among the flavonoids tested, 
      7-hydroxy-6-methoxyflavanone (1) and formononetin (4) exhibited strong inhibitory 
      activity against Streptococcus mutans SrtA, with IC(50) values of 46.1 and 41.8 µM, 
      respectively, but did not affect cell viability. The onset and magnitude of 
      inhibition of saliva-induced aggregation in S. mutans treated with compounds 1 and 4 
      were comparable to the behavior of a srtA-deletion mutant without treatment.

      Isopeptide Ligation.
PG  - 1058-1066
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00099 [doi]
AB  - Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have demonstrated great therapeutic potential due to 
      their ability to target the delivery of potent cytotoxins. However, the 
      heterogeneous nature of conventional drug conjugation strategies can affect the 
      safety, efficacy, and stability of ADCs. Site-specific conjugations can resolve 
      these issues, but often require genetic modification of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), 
      which can impact yield or cost of production, or require undesirable chemical 
      linkages. Here, we describe a near-traceless conjugation method that enables the 
      efficient modification of native IgG, without the need for genetic engineering or 
      glycan modification. This method utilizes engineered variants of sortase A to 
      catalyze noncanonical isopeptide ligation. Sortase A was fused to an 
      antibody-binding domain to improve ligation efficiency. Antibody labeling is limited 
      to five lysine residues on the heavy chain and one on the light chain of human IgG1. 
      The ADCs exhibit conserved antigen and Fc-receptor interactions, as well as potent 
      cytolytic activity.

TI  - Nanobody-Engineered Natural Killer Cell Conjugates for Solid Tumor Adoptive 
      Immunotherapy.
PG  - e2103463
LID - 10.1002/smll.202103463 [doi]
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy based on natural killer (NK) cells is demonstrated to be a 
      promising strategy. However, NK cells are deficient in ligands that target specific 
      tumors, resulting in limited antitumor efficacy. Here, a glycoengineering approach 
      to imitate the chimeric antigen receptor strategy and decorate NK cells with 
      nanobodies to promote NK-based immunotherapy in solid tumors is proposed. Nanobody 
      7D12, which specifically recognizes the human epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR) that is overexpressed on many solid tumors, is coupled to the chemically 
      synthesized DBCO-PEG(4) -GGG-NH(2) by sortase A-mediated ligation to generate 
      DBCO-7D12. The NK92MI cells bearing azide groups are then equipped with DBCO-7D12 
      via bioorthogonal click chemistry. The resultant 7D12-NK92MI cells exhibit high 
      specificity and affinity for EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo by 
      the 7D12-EGFR interaction, causing increased cytokine secretion to more effectively 
      kill EGFR-positive tumor cells, but not EGFR-negative cancer cells. Importantly, the 
      7D12-NK92MI cells also show a wide anticancer spectrum and extensive tumor 
      penetration. Furthermore, mouse experiments reveal that 7D12-NK92MI treatment 
      achieves excellent therapeutic efficacy and outstanding safety. The authors' works 
      provide a cell modification strategy using specific protein ligands without genetic 
      manipulation and present a potential novel method for cancer-targeted immunotherapy 
      by NK cells.

AB  - In this work we explored an enzyme-mediated method for selective and efficient 
      decoration of aqueous microgels with biomolecules. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (VCL) 
      microgels with varied amounts of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) as comonomer 
      incorporated in the microgel shell were synthesized and characterized in regard to 
      their size, swelling degree, and temperature-responsiveness in aqueous solutions. 
      The surface of the PVCL/GMA microgel containing 5 mol % glycidyl methyacrylate was 
      modified by grafting of a specific recognition peptide sequence (LPETG) for Sortase 
      A from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa-SrtA(Δ59)). Sortase-mediated conjugation of the 
      enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) carrying a N-terminal triglycine tag to 
      LPETG-modified microgels was successfully performed. Conjugation of eGFP to the 
      microgel surface was qualitatively proven by confocal microscopy and by fluorescence 
      intensity measurements. The developed protocol enables a precise control of the 
      amount of eGFP grafted to the microgel surface as evidenced by the linear increase 
      of fluorescence intensity of modified microgel samples. The kinetic of the 
      sortase-mediated coupling reaction was determined by time-dependent fluorescence 
      intensity measurements. In summary, sortase-mediated coupling reactions are a simple 
      and powerful technique for targeted surface functionalization of stimuli-responsive 
      microgels with biomolecules.

TI  - Does Curcumin Have an Anticaries Effect? A Systematic Review of In Vitro Studies.
PG  - 213-227
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-56153-6_12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental caries is one of the most important oral health problems and a 
      common infectious microbial disease. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) has been 
      regarded as the primary etiologic factor in the formation of dental caries. Curcumin 
      (CUR) has an antibacterial action and could be used in the eradication of S. mutans 
      to control dental caries. This systematic review was undertaken with the aim of 
      evaluating the anticaries effect of CUR. METHODS: A comprehensive search was 
      conducted in the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane - CENTRAL, and Scopus databases. Based on 
      the PICO model, studies which evaluated the anticaries effects of CUR up until 24 
      February 2020 with language restrictions were selected for this systematic review. 
      RESULTS: From 753 papers found, 13 met the eligibility criteria and were included. 
      In 12 out of 13 included studies, CUR had significant antibacterial and anticaries 
      effects. CUR had inhibitory effects on S. mutans growth, acid production, ATPase and 
      sortase A activity, biomass, viability and metabolism reduction of biofilm, reduced 
      exopolysaccharide production of biofilms, changes in biofilm structure, and had 
      anti-adhesion effects against S. mutans. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests 
      promising antibacterial and anticaries effects of CUR including inhibition of S. 
      mutans growth, acid production, ATPase and sortase A activity. This review provides 
      unique information regarding the potential role of CUR in the prevention and 
      treatment of dental carries as a natural, accessible, safe, and inexpensive agent to 
      increase oral and dental health. However, clinical randomized controlled trials are 
      needed to confirm these results.

PG  - 2955-61
LID - 10.1002/bit.24585 [doi]
AB  - The catalytic activity of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) is dependent on 
      Ca(2+), because binding of Ca(2+) to Glu residues distal to the active site 
      stabilizes the substrate binding site. To obtain Ca(2+)-independent SaSrtA, we 
      substituted two Glu residues in the Ca(2+)-binding pocket (Glu(105) and Glu(108)). 
      Although single mutations decreased SaSrtA activity, mutations of both Glu(105) and 
      Glu(108) resulted in Ca(2+)-independent activity. Kinetic analysis suggested that 
      the double mutations affect the substrate binding site, without affecting substrate 
      specificity. This approach will allow us to develop SaSrtA variants suitable for 
      various applications, including in vivo site-specific protein modification and 
      labeling.

AB  - In Gram-positive bacteria, Sortase A (Srt A) is a critical cysteine transpeptidase 
      that is responsible for recognizing and assembling surface virulence proteins 
      through the recognition of a LPXTG (leucine, proline, X, threonine, and glycine, 
      where X is any amino acid) signal. Mutants lacking genes for Srt A attenuate 
      infections without affecting microbial viability. Here a series of 
      2-phenyl-benzofuran-3-carboxamide derivatives were synthesized and identified as 
      potent Srt A inhibitors. Activity assays revealed that multiple compounds exhibited 
      excellent inhibitory activity against Srt A compared with known Sortase A inhibitor 
      pHMB (IC(50)=130μM). Structural activity relationships (SARs) demonstrated that the 
      amide group at 3-position was essential for inhibitory activity. Replacement of the 
      hydroxyl group at the 2-phenyl position of benzofuran with other substitutions such 
      as a methoxyl, halogen or nitro group reduced the enzyme inhibitory activity in most 
      cases. The compound Ia-22 was found to be the most potent inhibitor against the 
      enzyme with an IC(50) value of 30.8μM. Molecular docking studies showed Ia-22 shared 
      similar binding pattern with substrate LPXTG in the binding pocket of Srt A (PDB: 
      2KID) including i-butyl stretching, L-shape pattern kinking, and H-bond interaction 
      with Srt A functional site residues Cys184, Trp194 and Arg197.

AB  - Lipid nanodiscs have broad applications in membrane protein assays, biotechnology 
      and materials science. Chemical modification of the nanodiscs to expand their 
      functional attributes is generally desirable for all of these uses. We present a 
      method for site-selective labelling of the N-terminus of the nanodisc's membrane 
      scaffold protein (MSP) using the Sortase A protein. Labelling of the MSP was 
      achieved when assembled within the lipid nanodisc architecture, demonstrating that 
      this method can be used as a retrofit approach to modification of preformed 
      nanodiscs before or during application. We label the MSP with a fluorescent 
      fluorescein moiety and use them to image nanodisc uptake into HeLa cells. The 
      Sortase A labelling method could be employed as a general approach to labelling 
      nanodiscs with application-specific functionalities.

      Nanomedicine.
PG  - 67-80
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9654-4_6 [doi]
AB  - The current advances in nanoengineered materials coupled with the precise targeting 
      capability of recombinant antibodies can create nanoscale diagnostics and 
      therapeutics which show enhanced accumulation and extended retention at a target 
      tissue. Smaller antibodies such as single-chain variable fragments (scFv) preserve 
      the selective and strong binding of their parent antibody to their antigen with the 
      benefits of low immunogenicity, more efficient tissue penetration and easy 
      introduction of functional residues suitable for site-specific conjugation. This is 
      of high importance as nonspecific antibody modification often involves attachment to 
      free cysteine or lysine amino acids which may reside in the active site, leading to 
      reduced antigen binding.In this chapter, we outline a facile and versatile 
      chemoenzymatic approach for production of targeted nanocarrier scFv conjugates using 
      the bacterial trans-peptidase Sortase A (Srt A). Srt A efficiently mediates 
      sequence-specific peptide ligation under mild conditions and has few undesirable 
      side reactions. We first describe the production, purification and characterization 
      of Srt A enzyme and a scFv construct which targets activated platelets, called 
      scFv(anti-GPIIb/IIIa). Following this, our protocol illustrates the chemoenzymatic 
      modification of the antibody at the C-terminus with an orthogonal click chemistry 
      linker. This avoids any random attachment to the biologically active antigen binding 
      site of the antibody. Finally, we describe the modification of a nanoparticle 
      surface with scFv attachment via two methods: (1) direct Sortase-mediated 
      conjugation; or (2) a two-step system which consists of scFv Sortase-mediated 
      conjugation followed by strain promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Finally, 
      methodology is described to assess the successful assembly of targeted particles.

TI  - Curcuma longa L. constituents inhibit sortase A and Staphylococcus aureus cell 
      adhesion to fibronectin.
PG  - 9005-9
AB  - The inhibitory activity of Curcuma longa L. (turmeric) rhizome constituents against 
      sortase A, a bacterial surface protein anchoring transpeptidase, from Staphylococcus 
      aureus ATCC 6538p was evaluated. The activity of the isolated compounds (1-4) was 
      compared to that of the positive control,p-hydroxymecuribenzoic acid (pHMB). The 
      biologically active components of C. longa rhizome were characterized by 
      spectroscopic analysis as the curcuminoids curcumin (1), demethoxycurcumin (2), and 
      bisdemethoxycurcumin (3). Curcumin was a potent inhibitor of sortase A, with an IC50 
      value of 13.8 +/- 0.7 microg/mL. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (IC50 = 31.9 +/- 1.2 
      microg/mL) and demethoxycurcumin (IC50 = 23.8 +/- 0.6 microg/mL) were more effective 
      than pHMB (IC50 = 40.6 +/- 1.2 microg/mL). The three isolated compounds (1-3) showed 
      no growth inhibitory activity against S. aureus strain Newman, with minimum 
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) greater than 200 microg/mL. Curcumin also exhibited 
      potent inhibitory activity against S. aureus cell adhesion to fibronectin. The 
      suppression of fibronectin-binding activity by curcumin highlights its potential for 
      the treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of sortase activity. These 
      results indicate that curcumin is a possible candidate in the development of a 
      bacterial sortase A inhibitor.

AB  - A series of novel 2-phenyl-benzo[d]oxazole-7-carboxamide derivatives were designed, 
      synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory activities against 
      Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A with known Sortase A inhibitor pHMB as positive 
      compound (IC50=130μM). Most compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activity 
      (IC50=19.8-184.2μM). Structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that 
      substitution at 7-position and 2-position of benzoxazole had great influence on the 
      activities. Specifically, the substituent at 7-position is indispensable for 
      inhibitory activity. The molecular docking studies revealed the i-butyl amide group 
      went towards the β6/β7 loop-β8 substructure of the protein and the benzoxazole core 
      lied in a hydrophobic pocket composed of Ala118, Val166, Val168, Val169 and Ile182, 
      shaping the whole molecule into a L-shape mode to be recognized by Sortase A.

AB  - Antibody fusion to nonprotein materials such as contrast agents or radio-tracers, 
      nano- or microparticles or small-molecule drugs is attracting major interest for 
      molecular imaging and drug delivery. Nondirected bioconjugation techniques may 
      impair antibody affinity, result in lower amounts of functional antibodies and 
      generate multicomponent mixtures. We present a detailed protocol for the enzymatic 
      bioconjugation of small recombinant antibodies to imaging particles, and we also 
      describe the generation of and conjugation to a low-fouling capsule assembled for 
      drug delivery from PEG and PVPON (poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) by a layer-by-layer (LbL) 
      technique. The single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is equipped with a short 
      C-terminal LPETG tag and the fusion partners are functionalized with an N-terminal 
      GGG nucleophilic group for sortase A conjugation. The LbL capsules are assembled 
      through hydrogen bonding by depositing alkyne-modified poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and 
      poly(methacrylic acid) layers on silica particles, followed by depositing 
      alkyne-modified PEG. The generation of the antibodies and LbL capsules takes ∼1-2 
      weeks each. The conjugation and functional testing takes another 3-4 d.

TI  - Identification of 1-chloro-2-formyl indenes and tetralenes as novel 
      antistaphylococcal agents exhibiting sortase A inhibition.
PG  - 2041-51
LID - 10.1007/s00253-013-5036-1 [doi]
AB  - Tetralene and indene compounds have shown inhibitory activity against human 
      pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Their potential use as antistaphylococcal 
      agent against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has not been explored so far. We 
      determined in vitro antistaphylococcal activity and mechanism of action of these 
      compounds as sortase A inhibitors through in silico analysis followed by biological 
      assays. Tetralene and indene series were tested against S. aureus strains MTCC96, 
      MRSA, and VA30. Three compounds showed significant reduction in MIC in both 
      wild-type and drug-resistant S. aureus strains. In silico absorption, distribution, 
      metabolism, excretion, and toxicity analysis of identified leads and cytotoxicity 
      testing with colorimetric method using Vero and WRL-68 cell lines showed no 
      significant cytotoxic effects. Molecular docking of these molecules with sortase A 
      (PDB: 2KID) showed H-bond interaction with functional site residue Arg197 of sortase 
      A. Sortase A inhibition assay was developed by expressing SrtA∆N from S. aureus 
      strain MTCC96. Tetralene and indene compounds were found to have sortase A 
      inhibitory potential. S. aureus strain MTCC96 treated with these compounds showed 
      surface-sorting inhibition of fibronectin-binding protein and reduction in adherence 
      to host extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin. 1-Chloro, 2-formyl, 6-methoxy, 
      1-tetralene (Tet-5), 1,5-dichloro, 2-formyl, 1-indene (Tet-20) and 1-chloro, 
      2-formyl, 5,6-methylenedioxy, and 1-indene (Tet-21) exhibited antistaphylococcal 
      activity along with sortase A inhibition. The results also indicate the possible 
      role of these leads in other reactions essential for cell viability.

TI  - Confirmation of a Protein-Protein Interaction in the Pantothenate Biosynthetic 
      Pathway by Using Sortase-Mediated Labelling.
PG  - 753-8
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201500547 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput studies have been widely used to identify protein-protein 
      interactions; however, few of these candidate interactions have been confirmed in 
      vitro. We have used a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and 
      fluorescence anisotropy to screen candidate interactions within the pantothenate 
      biosynthetic pathway. In particular, we observed no interaction between the next 
      enzyme in the pathway, pantothenate synthetase (PS), and aspartate decarboxylase, 
      but did observe an interaction between PS and the putative Nudix hydrolase, YfcD. 
      Confirmation of the interaction by fluorescence anisotropy was dependent upon 
      labelling an adventitiously formed glycine on the protein N-terminal affinity 
      purification tag by using Sortase. Subsequent formation of the protein-protein 
      complex led to apparent restriction of the dynamics of this tag, thus suggesting 
      that this approach could be generally applied to a subset of other protein-protein 
      interaction complexes.

TI  - Identification of sortase A (SrtA) substrates in Streptococcus uberis: evidence for 
      an additional hexapeptide (LPXXXD) sorting motif.
PG  - 1088-95
LID - 10.1021/pr901025w [doi]
AB  - Sortase (a transamidase) has been shown to be responsible for the covalent 
      attachment of proteins to the bacterial cell wall. Anchoring is effected on secreted 
      proteins containing a specific cell wall motif toward their C-terminus; that for 
      sortase A (SrtA) in Gram-positive bacteria often incorporates the sequence LPXTG. 
      Such surface proteins are often characterized as virulence determinants and play 
      important roles during the establishment and persistence of infection. Intramammary 
      infection with Streptococcus uberis is a common cause of bovine mastitis, which 
      impacts on animal health and welfare and the economics of milk production. 
      Comparison of stringently produced cell wall fractions from S. uberis and an 
      isogenic mutant strain lacking SrtA permitted identification of 9 proteins likely to 
      be covalently anchored at the cell surface. Analysis of these sequences implied the 
      presence of two anchoring motifs for S. uberis, the classical LPXTG motif and an 
      additional LPXXXD motif.

AB  - Protein assemblies are an emerging tool that is finding many biological and 
      bioengineering applications. We here propose a method for the site-specific assembly 
      of proteins on a twigged streptavidin (SA) polymer using streptavidin as a 
      functional scaffold. SA was genetically appended with a G tag (sortase A recognition 
      sequence) and a Y tag (HRP recognition sequence) on its N- and C-termini, 
      respectively, to provide G-SA-Y. G-SA-Y was polymerized using HPR-mediated tyrosine 
      coupling, then fluorescent proteins were immobilized on the polymer by biotin-SA 
      affinity and sortase A-mediated ligation. Fluorescence measurements showed that the 
      proteins were immobilized in close proximity to each other. Hydrolyzing enzymes were 
      also functionally assembled on the G-SA-Y polymer. The site-specific assembly of 
      proteins on twigged SA polymer may find new applications in various biological and 
      bioengineering fields.

AB  - Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), a promising class of cancer biopharmaceuticals, 
      combine the specificity of therapeutic antibodies with the pharmacological potency 
      of chemical, cytotoxic drugs. Ever since the first ADCs on the market, a plethora of 
      novel ADC technologies has emerged, covering as diverse aspects as antibody 
      engineering, chemical linker optimization and novel conjugation strategies, together 
      aiming at constantly widening the therapeutic window for ADCs. This review primarily 
      focuses on novel chemical and biotechnological strategies for the site-directed 
      attachment of drugs that are currently validated for 2nd generation ADCs to promote 
      conjugate homogeneity and overall stability.

TI  - PorZ, an Essential Component of the Type IX Secretion System of Porphyromonas 
      gingivalis, Delivers Anionic Lipopolysaccharide to the PorU Sortase for 
      Transpeptidase Processing of T9SS Cargo Proteins.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.02262-20 [doi]
LID - e02262-20
AB  - Cargo proteins of the type IX secretion system (T9SS) in human pathogens from the 
      Bacteroidetes phylum invariably possess a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that 
      functions as a signal for outer membrane (OM) translocation. In Porphyromonas 
      gingivalis, the CTD of cargos is cleaved off after translocation, and anionic 
      lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) is attached. This transpeptidase reaction anchors 
      secreted proteins to the OM. PorZ, a cell surface-associated protein, is an 
      essential component of the T9SS whose function was previously unknown. We recently 
      solved the crystal structure of PorZ and found that it consists of two β-propeller 
      moieties, followed by a CTD. In this study, we performed structure-based modeling, 
      suggesting that PorZ is a carbohydrate-binding protein. Indeed, we found that 
      recombinant PorZ specifically binds A-LPS in vitro Binding was blocked by monoclonal 
      antibodies that specifically react with a phosphorylated branched mannan in the 
      anionic polysaccharide (A-PS) component of A-LPS, but not with the core 
      oligosaccharide or the lipid A endotoxin. Examination of A-LPS derived from a cohort 
      of mutants producing various truncations of A-PS confirmed that the phosphorylated 
      branched mannan is indeed the PorZ ligand. Moreover, purified recombinant PorZ 
      interacted with the PorU sortase in an A-LPS-dependent manner. This interaction on 
      the cell surface is crucial for the function of the "attachment complex" composed of 
      PorU, PorZ, and the integral OM β-barrel proteins PorV and PorQ, which is involved 
      in posttranslational modification and retention of T9SS cargos on the bacterial 
      surface.IMPORTANCE Bacteria have evolved multiple systems to transport effector 
      proteins to their surface or into the surrounding milieu. These proteins have a wide 
      range of functions, including attachment, motility, nutrient acquisition, and 
      toxicity in the host. Porphyromonas gingivalis, the human pathogen responsible for 
      severe gum diseases (periodontitis), uses a recently characterized type IX secretion 
      system (T9SS) to translocate and anchor secreted virulence effectors to the cell 
      surface. Anchorage is facilitated by sortase, an enzyme that covalently attaches 
      T9SS cargo proteins to a unique anionic lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) moiety of P. 
      gingivalis Here, we show that the T9SS component PorZ interacts with sortase and 
      specifically binds A-LPS. Binding is mediated by a phosphorylated branched mannan 
      repeat in A-LPS polysaccharide. A-LPS-bound PorZ interacts with sortase with 
      significantly higher affinity, facilitating modification of cargo proteins by the 
      cell surface attachment complex of the T9SS.

TI  - RecT Recombinase Expression Enables Efficient Gene Editing in Enterococcus spp.
PG  - e0084421
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00844-21 [doi]
LID - e00844-21
AB  - Enterococcus faecium is a ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterium that has been recovered 
      from the environment, food, and microbiota of mammals. Commensal strains of E. 
      faecium can confer beneficial effects on host physiology and immunity, but 
      antibiotic usage has afforded antibiotic-resistant and pathogenic isolates from 
      livestock and humans. However, the dissection of E. faecium functions and mechanisms 
      has been restricted by inefficient gene-editing methods. To address these 
      limitations, here, we report that the expression of E. faecium RecT recombinase 
      significantly improves the efficiency of recombineering technologies in both 
      commensal and antibiotic-resistant strains of E. faecium and other Enterococcus 
      species such as E. durans and E. hirae. Notably, the expression of RecT in 
      combination with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR)-Cas9 and guide RNAs (gRNAs) enabled highly efficient scarless 
      single-stranded DNA recombineering to generate specific gene-editing mutants in E. 
      faecium. Moreover, we demonstrate that E. faecium RecT expression facilitated 
      chromosomal insertions of double-stranded DNA templates encoding 
      antibiotic-selectable markers to generate gene deletion mutants. As a further proof 
      of principle, we use CRISPR-Cas9-mediated recombineering to knock out both sortase A 
      genes in E. faecium for downstream functional characterization. The general 
      RecT-mediated recombineering methods described here should significantly enhance 
      genetic studies of E. faecium and other closely related species for functional and 
      mechanistic studies. IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecium is widely recognized as an 
      emerging public health threat with the rise of drug resistance and nosocomial 
      infections. Nevertheless, commensal Enterococcus strains possess beneficial health 
      functions in mammals to upregulate host immunity and prevent microbial infections. 
      This functional dichotomy of Enterococcus species and strains highlights the need 
      for in-depth studies to discover and characterize the genetic components underlying 
      its diverse activities. However, current genetic engineering methods in E. faecium 
      still require passive homologous recombination from plasmid DNA. This involves the 
      successful cloning of multiple homologous fragments into a plasmid, introducing the 
      plasmid into E. faecium, and screening for double-crossover events that can 
      collectively take up to multiple weeks to perform. To alleviate these challenges, we 
      show that RecT recombinase enables the rapid and efficient integration of mutagenic 
      DNA templates to generate substitutions, deletions, and insertions in the genomic 
      DNA of E. faecium. These improved recombineering methods should facilitate 
      functional and mechanistic studies of Enterococcus.

TI  - Efficient segmental isotope labeling of multi-domain proteins using Sortase A.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1007/s10858-015-9981-0 [doi]
AB  - NMR studies of multi-domain protein complexes provide unique insight into their 
      molecular interactions and dynamics in solution. For large proteins domain-selective 
      isotope labeling is desired to reduce signal overlap, but available methods require 
      extensive optimization and often give poor ligation yields. We present an optimized 
      strategy for segmental labeling of multi-domain proteins using the S. aureus 
      transpeptidase Sortase A. Critical improvements compared to existing protocols are 
      (1) the efficient removal of cleaved peptide fragments by centrifugal filtration and 
      (2) a strategic design of cleavable and non-cleavable affinity tags for 
      purification. Our approach enables routine production of milligram amounts of 
      purified segmentally labeled protein for NMR and other biophysical studies.

TI  - Selective Functionalization of Microgels with Enzymes by Sortagging.
PG  - 2859-2869
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00568 [doi]
AB  - Enzyme immobilization has been widely used to improve the stability and 
      recyclability of enzymes in industrial processes. In this work, a sortase-mediated 
      and therefore selective covalent immobilization strategy (sortagging) for enzymes on 
      microgels (GelZyms) was investigated. Aqueous microgels were synthesized from 
      poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)/glycidyl methacrylate (PVCL/GMA) and tagged with the 
      sortase A recognition peptide sequence (LPETG) or its nucleophilic counterpart-tag 
      (GGG). General applicability and selective immobilization were confirmed by 
      subsequent sortagging of five different enzymes (Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA), 
      Yersinia mollaretii phytase (Ym-phytase), Escherichia coli copper efflux oxidase 
      (CueO laccase), cellulase A2, and Bacillus megaterium monooxygenase P450 BM3). The 
      latter was performed directly from the cell lysate to ensure cost-effective 
      immobilization. All five immobilized enzymes were catalytically active and could be 
      recycled (e.g., laccase CueO and monooxygenase P450 BM3 F87A; >55% residual activity 
      after six cycles). Application potential was demonstrated by using CueO decorated 
      microgels for bleaching of the synthetic dye indigo carmine.

      obtained by consensus design.
PG  - 555-564
LID - 10.1093/protein/gzaa018 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) is an enzyme that anchors proteins to the 
      cell surface of Gram-positive bacteria. During the transpeptidation reaction 
      performed by SaSrtA, proteins containing an N-terminal glycine can be covalently 
      linked to another protein with a C-terminal LPXTG motif (X being any amino acid). 
      Since the sortase reaction can be performed in vitro as well, it has found many 
      applications in biotechnology. Although sortase-mediated ligation has many 
      advantages, SaSrtA is limited by its low enzymatic activity and dependence on Ca2+. 
      In our study, we evaluated the thermodynamic stability of the SaSrtA wild type and 
      found the enzyme to be stable. We applied consensus analysis to further improve the 
      enzyme's stability while at the same time enhancing the enzyme's activity. As a 
      result, we found thermodynamically improved, more active and Ca2+-independent 
      mutants. We envision that these new variants can be applied in conjugation reactions 
      in low Ca2+ environments.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A is an attractive target of Gram-positive bacteria 
      that plays a crucial role in anchoring of surface proteins to peptidoglycan present 
      in bacterial cell wall. Inhibiting sortase A is an elementary and essential effort 
      in preventing the pathogenesis. In this context, in silico virtual screening of 
      in-house database was performed using ligand based pharmacophore model as a filter. 
      The developed pharmacophore model AAHR 11 consists of two acceptors, one hydrophobic 
      and one ring aromatic feature. Top ranked molecule KKR1 was docked into the active 
      site of the target. After profound analysis, it was analyzed and optimized based on 
      the observations from its binding pose orientation. Upgraded version of KKR1 was 
      KKR2 and has improved docking score, binding interactions and best fit in the 
      binding pocket. KKR1 along with KKR2 were further validated using 100 ns molecular 
      dynamic studies. Both KKR1 and KKR2 contain Indole-thiazolidine moiety and were 
      synthesized. The disk diffusion assay has good initial results (ZI of KKR1, KKR2 
      were 24, 38 mm at 10 μg/mL and ZI of Ampicillin was 22 at 10 μg/mL) and calculated 
      MICs of the molecules (KKR1 5.56±0.28 μg/mL, KKR2 1.32±0.12 μg/mL, Ampicillin 8±1.1 
      μg/mL) were in good agreement with standard drug Ampicillin. KKR1 has shown IC50 of 
      1.23±0.14 μM whereas the optimized lead molecule KKR2 show IC50 of 0.008±0.07 μM. 
      Results from in silico were validated by in vitro studies and proved that 
      indole-thiazolidine molecules would be useful for future development as lead 
      molecules against S. aureus sortase A.

TI  - Depsipeptide substrates for sortase-mediated N-terminal protein ligation.
PG  - 253-62
LID - 10.1038/nprot.2014.003 [doi]
AB  - Technologies that allow the efficient chemical modification of proteins under mild 
      conditions are widely sought after. Sortase-mediated peptide ligation provides a 
      strategy for modifying the N or C terminus of proteins. This protocol describes the 
      use of depsipeptide substrates (containing an ester linkage) with sortase A (SrtA) 
      to completely modify proteins carrying a single N-terminal glycine residue under 
      mild conditions in 4-6 h. The SrtA-mediated ligation reaction is reversible, so most 
      labeling protocols that use this enzyme require a large excess of both substrate and 
      sortase to produce high yields of ligation product. In contrast, switching to 
      depsipeptide substrates effectively renders the reaction irreversible, allowing 
      complete labeling of proteins with a small excess of substrate and catalytic 
      quantities of sortase. Herein we describe the synthesis of depsipeptide substrates 
      that contain an ester linkage between a threonine and glycolic acid residue and an 
      N-terminal FITC fluorophore appended via a thiourea linkage. The synthesis of the 
      depsipeptide substrate typically takes 2-3 d.

      sortase-mediated coupling of copper-64 to a single-chain antibody.
PG  - 6115-9
LID - 10.1002/anie.201402613 [doi]
AB  - The enzyme-mediated site-specific bioconjugation of a radioactive metal complex to a 
      single-chain antibody using the transpeptidase sortase A is reported. Cage amine 
      sarcophagine ligands that were designed to function as substrates for the sortase A 
      mediated bioconjugation to antibodies were synthesized and enzymatically conjugated 
      to a single-chain variable fragment. The antibody fragment scFv(anti-LIBS) targets 
      ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS) on the glycoprotein receptor GPIIb/IIIa, which 
      is present on activated platelets. The immunoconjugates were radiolabeled with the 
      positron-emitting isotope (64)Cu. The new radiolabeled conjugates were shown to bind 
      selectively to activated platelets. The diagnostic potential of the most promising 
      conjugate was demonstrated in an in vivo model of carotid artery thrombosis using 
      positron emission tomography. This approach gives homogeneous products through 
      site-specific enzyme-mediated conjugation and should be broadly applicable to other 
      metal complexes and proteins.

AB  - Identification of tumors which over-express Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) 
      is important in selecting patients for anti-EGFR therapies. Enzymatic bioconjugation 
      was used to introduce positron-emitting radionuclides ((89)Zr, (64)Cu) into an 
      anti-EGFR antibody fragment for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging the same 
      day as injection. A monovalent antibody fragment with high affinity for EGFR was 
      engineered to include a sequence that is recognized by the transpeptidase sortase A. 
      Two different metal chelators, one for (89)Zr(IV) and one for (64)Cu(II), were 
      modified with a N-terminal glycine to enable them to act as substrates in sortase A 
      mediated bioconjugation to the antibody fragment. Both fragments provided 
      high-quality PET images of EGFR positive tumors in a mouse model at 3 hours 
      post-injection, a significant advantage when compared to radiolabeled full 
      antibodies that require several days between injection of the tracer and imaging. 
      The use of enzymatic bioconjugation gives reproducible homogeneous products with the 
      metal complexes selectively installed on the C-terminus of the antibody potentially 
      simplifying regulatory approval.

LID - 488
AB  - Four new peptides were isolated from the culture broths of the marine-derived fungi 
      Aspergillus allahabadii and A. ochraceopetaliformis. Based on the results of 
      chemical and spectroscopic analyses, two compounds (1 and 2) from A. allahabadii 
      were determined to be cyclopentapeptides, while those from A. ochraceopetaliformis 
      were a structurally-related cyclodepsihexapeptide (3) and its linear analog (4). In 
      addition to the presence of a D-amino acid residue, the almost reversed sequence of 
      peptides in 3 and 4, relative to those of the 1 and 2, is notable. These new 
      compounds exhibited moderate inhibition against the enzyme sortase A as well as a 
      weak inhibition against isocitrate lyase (2).

TI  - Convenient Auto-Processing Vector Based on Bamboo Mosaic Virus for Presentation of 
      Antigens Through Enzymatic Coupling.
PG  - 739837

LID - 739837
AB  - We have developed a new binary epitope-presenting CVP platform based on bamboo 
      mosaic virus (BaMV) by using the sortase A (SrtA)-mediated ligation technology. The 
      reconstructed BaMV genome harbors two modifications: 1) a coat protein (CP) with 
      N-terminal extension of the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site plus 
      4 extra glycine (G) residues as the SrtA acceptor; and 2) a TEV protease coding 
      region replacing that of the triple-gene-block proteins. Inoculation of such 
      construct, pKB5G, on Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in the efficient production of 
      filamentous CVPs ready for SrtA-mediated ligation with desired proteins. The second 
      part of the binary platform includes an expression vector for the bacterial 
      production of donor proteins. We demonstrated the applicability of the platform by 
      using the recombinant envelope protein domain III (rEDIII) of Japanese encephalitis 
      virus (JEV) as the antigen. Up to 40% of the BaMV CP subunits in each CVP were 
      loaded with rEDIII proteins in 1 min. The rEDIII-presenting BaMV CVPs (BJLPET5G) 
      could be purified using affinity chromatography. Immunization assays confirmed that 
      BJLPET5G could induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against JEV 
      infections. The binary platform could be adapted as a useful alternative for the 
      development and mass production of vaccine candidates.

      function of probiotics as safe microorganisms and the study of their relevant 
      functional mechanisms have recently been in the spotlight. Finding the mechanisms of 
      attachment and stability and their beneficial effects on the immune system can be 
      useful in identifying and increasing the therapeutic effects of probiotics. In this 
      review, the functional mechanisms of probiotics were comprehensively investigated. 
      Relevant articles were searched in scientific sources, documents, and databases, 
      including PubMed, NCBI, Bactibace, OptiBac, and Bagel4. The most important 
      functional mechanisms of probiotics and their effects on strengthening the 
      epithelial barrier, competitive inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, production 
      of antimicrobials, binding and interaction with the host, and regulatory effects on 
      the immune system were discussed.In this regard, the attachment of probiotics to the 
      epithelium is very important because the prerequisite for their proper functioning 
      is to establish a proper connection to the epithelium. Therefore, more attention 
      should be paid to the binding effect of probiotics, including sortase A, a 
      significant factor involved in the expression of sortase-dependent proteins (SDP), 
      on their surface as mediators of intestinal epithelial cell binding. In general, by 
      investigating the functional mechanisms of probiotics, it was concluded that the 
      mechanism by which probiotics regulate the immune system and adhesion capacity can 
      directly and indirectly have preventive and therapeutic effects on a wide range of 
      diseases. However, further study of these mechanisms requires extensive research on 
      various aspects.

AB  - The combination of investigating a unique source of chemically prolific bacterium 
      with an LC/MS-based bacterial strain selection approach resulted in the discovery of 
      two new secondary metabolites, buanmycin (1) and buanquinone (2), from the culture 
      of a marine Streptomyces strain, which was isolated from a tidal mudflat in Buan, 
      Republic of Korea. The carbon backbone of buanmycin (1), comprising 20 quaternary 
      carbons out of 30 total carbons, was determined via (13)C-(13)C COSY NMR analysis 
      after labeling 1 with (13)C by culturing the bacterium with (13)C-glucose. The 
      complete structure of 1 was confidently elucidated, primarily based on 1D and 2D NMR 
      spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis, as that of a new pentacyclic 
      xanthone. The absolute configuration of the α-methyl serine unit in 1 was 
      established by applying the advanced Marfey's method. The structure of buanquinone 
      (2) was determined to be a new pentacyclic quinone based on NMR and MS spectroscopic 
      data. Buanmycin exhibited potent cytotoxicity against colorectal carcinoma cells 
      (HCT-116) and gastric carcinoma cells (SNU-638) with submicromolar IC50 values and 
      strongly inhibited the pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica (MIC = 
      0.7 μM). In particular, buanmycin demonstrated inhibition of sortase A, which is a 
      promising target for antibiotic discovery.

AB  - Affibody molecules are small engineered scaffold proteins suitable for in vivo tumor 
      targeting. Radionuclide molecular imaging using directly radiolabelled affibody 
      molecules provides excellent imaging. However, affibody molecules have a high renal 
      reabsorption, which complicates their use for radionuclide therapy. The high renal 
      reabsorption is a common problem for the use of engineered scaffold proteins for 
      radionuclide therapy. Affibody-based PNA-mediated pretargeting reduces 
      dramatically the absorbed dose to the kidneys and makes affibody-based radionuclide 
      therapy possible. This methodology might, hopefully, solve the problem of high renal 
      reabsorption for radionuclide therapy mediated by other engineered scaffold 
      proteins.

AB  - Bacteria forming biofilms on surgical implants is a problem that might be alleviated 
      by the use of antibacterial coatings. In this article, recombinant spider silk was 
      functionalized with the peptidoglycan degrading endolysin SAL-1 from the 
      staphylococcal bacteriophage SAP-1 and the biofilm-matrix-degrading enzyme Dispersin 
      B from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using direct genetic fusion and/or 
      covalent protein-protein fusion catalyzed by Sortase A. Spider silk assembly and 
      enzyme immobilization was monitored using quartz crystal microbalance analysis. 
      Enzyme activity was investigated both with a biochemical assay using cleavage of 
      fluorescent substrate analogues and bacterial assays for biofilm degradation and 
      turbidity reduction. Spider silk coatings functionalized with SAL-1 and Disperin B 
      were found to exhibit bacteriolytic effect and inhibit biofilm formation, 
      respectively. The strategy to immobilize antibacterial enzymes to spider silk 
      presented herein show potential to be used as surface coatings of surgical implants 
      and other medical equipment to avoid bacterial colonization.

AB  - Sortases are enzymes mostly found in Gram-positive bacteria which cleave proteins 
      site-specifically. This feature makes them a promising tool in molecular biology and 
      biotechnology. In this study, using bacterial surface display of recombinant 
      proteins and ability of sortase A in site-specifically cleavage of the amino acid 
      sequences, a novel method for one-step purification of recombinant proteins was 
      developed. Using computational program tools, a chimeric protein containing a 
      metallothionein (mt) and chitin binding domain (ChBD) was attached to the C-terminal 
      domain of the truncated outer membrane protein A (Lpp'-ompA) using sortase 
      recognition site (amino acid residues: LPQTG) as a separator. The structure of the 
      chimeric protein was simulated using molecular dynamics to determine if the LPQTG 
      motif is accessible to the sortase active site. The designed chimeric protein was 
      expressed and purified. The purified chimeric protein was also displayed on the 
      surface of E. coli cells. Both purified chimeric protein and the E. coli cells 
      displaying Lpp'-ompA-mt-ChBD carrier protein were then treated with sortase to 
      evaluate the efficiency of sortase-mediated cleavage of purified chimeric protein as 
      well as surface displayed-chimeric protein. It is shown that mt-ChBD protein was 
      successfully cleaved and dissociated from Lpp'-ompA carrier and released into the 
      medium after treatment with sortase in both recombinant protein and surface 
      displayed-chimeric protein. The experimental results confirmed the molecular 
      dynamics analysis results. The presented method could be regarded as a novel 
      strategy for one step expression and purification of recombinant proteins.

AB  - Antibody-DNA conjugates are powerful tools for DNA-assisted protein analysis. 
      Growing usage of these methods demands efficient production of high-quality 
      conjugates. We developed an easy and fast synthesis route yielding covalent 
      antibody-DNA conjugates with a defined conjugation site and low batch-to-batch 
      variability. We utilize the Z domain from protein A, containing the unnatural amino 
      acid 4-benzoylphenylalanine (BPA) for photoaffinity labeling of the antibodies' Fc 
      region. Z(xBPA) domains are C-terminally modified with triple-glycine 
      (G(3))-modified DNA-oligonucleotides via enzymatic Sortase A coupling. We show 
      reliable modification of the most commonly used IgG's. To prove our conjugates' 
      functionality, we detected antibody-antigen binding events in an assay called 
      Droplet Barcode Sequencing for Protein analysis (DBS-Pro). It confirms not only 
      retained functionality for both conjugate parts but also the potential of using 
      DBS-Pro for quantifying protein abundances. As intermediates are easily storable and 
      our approach is modular, it offers a convenient strategy for screening various 
      antibody-DNA conjugates using the same starting material.

TI  - High-Throughput Screening Strategies for the Development of Anti-Virulence 
      Inhibitors Against Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 2297-2312
LID - 10.2174/0929867324666171121102829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing threats of antibiotic resistance urge the need for 
      developing new approaches to combat bacterial infections including those caused by 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Unlike conventional antibiotics that aim to kill 
      bacteria or inhibit their growth, targeting bacterial virulence may be a promising 
      alternative approach, which imposes less selective pressure for antibiotic 
      resistance in future generations. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to provide a systematic 
      review about developing high-throughput screening (HTS) strategies for the 
      identification of inhibitors targeting virulence of S. aureus. We also describe an 
      overview of virulence regulatory pathways for potential antivirulence targets. 
      METHODS: We focus on five potential targets or target families, including agr quorum 
      sensing system, SarA/MgrA protein family, sortase A, Clp protease and 
      eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr phosphatase (Stp1). For each target, we introduce its role 
      in virulence regulation, summarize the HTS approaches that are used to identify 
      novel anti-virulence inhibitors, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of 
      these strategies. CONCLUSION: The discovery of anti-virulence inhibitors via HTS 
      underlines the promising potential of anti-virulence therapy for S. aureus. The 
      development of HTS strategies can facilitate the identification of novel 
      anti-virulence inhibitors for combating S. aureus infection, and may also advance 
      our understanding on virulence regulation in S. aureus.

TI  - Bioactive Silk Coatings Reduce the Adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus while 
      Supporting Growth of Osteoblast-like Cells.
PG  - 24999-25007
LID - 10.1021/acsami.9b05531 [doi]
AB  - Orthopedic and dental implants are associated with a substantial risk of failure due 
      to biomaterial-associated infections and poor osseointegration. To prevent such 
      outcomes, a coating can be applied on the implant to ideally both reduce the risk of 
      bacterial adhesion and support establishment of osteoblasts. We present a strategy 
      to construct dual-functional silk coatings with such properties. Silk coatings were 
      made from a recombinant partial spider silk protein either alone (silk(wt)) or fused 
      with a cell-binding motif derived from fibronectin (FN-silk). The biofilm-dispersal 
      enzyme Dispersin B (DspB) and two peptidoglycan degrading endolysins, PlySs2 and 
      SAL-1, were produced recombinantly. A sortase recognition tag (SrtTag) was included 
      to allow site-specific conjugation of each enzyme onto silk(wt) and FN-silk coatings 
      using an engineered variant of the transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA*). To evaluate 
      bacterial adhesion on the samples, Staphylococcus aureus was incubated on the 
      coatings and subsequently subjected to live/dead staining. Fluorescence microscopy 
      revealed a reduced number of bacteria on all silk coatings containing enzymes. 
      Moreover, the bacteria were mobile to a higher degree, indicating a negative 
      influence on the bacterial adhesion. The capability to support mammalian cell 
      interactions was assessed by cultivation of the osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS on 
      dual-functional surfaces, prepared by conjugating the enzymes onto FN-silk coatings. 
      U-2 OS cells could adhere to silk coatings with enzymes and showed high spreading 
      and viability, demonstrating good cell compatibility.

TI  - Exendin 4-Hapten Conjugate Capable of Binding with Endogenous Antibodies for Peptide 
      Half-life Extension and Exerting Long-Acting Hypoglycemic Activity.
PG  - 4947-4959
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00032 [doi]
AB  - Hapten-specific endogenous antibodies are naturally occurring antibodies present in 
      human blood. Herein, we investigated a new strategy in which small-molecule haptens 
      were utilized as naturally occurring antibody binders for peptide half-life 
      extension. The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist exendin 4 was 
      site-specifically functionalized with the dinitrophenyl (DNP) hapten at the 
      C-terminus via sortase A-mediated ligation. The resulting Ex4-DNP conjugates 
      retained GLP-1 receptor activation potency in vitro and had a similar in vivo acute 
      glucose-lowering effect comparable to that of native Ex4. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      and hypoglycemic duration tests demonstrated that the Ex4-DNP conjugates displayed 
      significantly elongated half-lives and improved long-acting antidiabetic activity in 
      the presence of endogenous anti-DNP antibodies. In chronic treatment studies, 
      once-daily administration of optimal conjugate 7 demonstrated more beneficial 
      effects without prominent toxicity compared with Ex4. This strategy provides a new 
      approach and represents an alternative to the well-established peptide-Fc fusion 
      strategy to improve the peptide half-life and the therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - A novel and versatile peptide-based bio-logic system capable of regulating cell 
      function is developed using sortase A (SrtA), a peptide ligation enzyme, as a 
      generic processor. By modular peptide design, we demonstrate that mammalian cells 
      apoptosis can be programmed by peptide-based logic operations, including binary and 
      combination gates (AND, INHIBIT, OR, and AND-INHIBIT), and a complex sequential 
      logic circuit (multi-input keypad lock). Moreover, a proof-of-concept peptide 
      regulatory circuit was developed to analyze the expression profile of cell-secreted 
      protein biomarkers and trigger cancer-cell-specific apoptosis.

TI  - Visualization and Quantification of Sortase Activity at the Single-Molecule Level 
      via Transpeptidation-Directed Intramolecular Förster Resonance Energy Transfer.
PG  - 13007-13012
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03716 [doi]
AB  - The sortase-catalyzed coupling reaction is an efficient strategy to incorporate 
      chemically defined modifications into proteins of interest. Despite its widespread 
      applications in protein chemistry, the conventional bulk fluorescence measurement is 
      not sufficient to characterize sortase due to the fluorescence inner filter 
      effect-induced self-quenching. Herein, we develop a new method to visualize and 
      quantify sortase A (SrtA) activity at the single-molecule level by using 
      transpeptidation-directed intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). 
      This assay utilizes two cyanine dye-peptide conjugates, in which one carries an 
      LPXTG motif and a donor fluorophore while the other harbors an oligoglycine 
      nucleophile and an acceptor fluorophore as the substrate of SrtA. The presence of 
      SrtA catalyzes the fusion of two conjugates and allows for the occurrence of 
      intramolecular FRET. The FRET signal is recorded at the single-molecule level via 
      total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-based imaging. The proposed assay not 
      only can accurately determine the kinetic parameters of SrtA but also can 
      characterize the inhibition of SrtA activity by berberine chloride both in vitro and 
      in Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus) cells. Moreover, the assay is very specific, 
      and it can sensitively measure SrtA down to 7.08 pM, which is much lower than most 
      of the reported methods. This strategy may provide a valuable tool for an in-depth 
      study of sortases and for the discovery of anti-infective agents.

TI  - An In Vitro Study of the Effect of Viburnum opulus Extracts on Key Processes in the 
      Development of Staphylococcal Infections.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26061758 [doi]
LID - 1758
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is still one of the leading causes of both hospital- and 
      community-acquired infections. Due to the very high percentage of drug-resistant 
      strains, the participation of drug-tolerant biofilms in pathological changes, and 
      thus the limited number of effective antibiotics, there is an urgent need to search 
      for alternative methods of prevention or treatment for S. aureus infections. In the 
      present study, biochemically characterized (HPLC/UPLC-QTOF-MS) acetonic, ethanolic, 
      and water extracts from fruits and bark of Viburnum opulus L. were tested in vitro 
      as diet additives that potentially prevent staphylococcal infections. The impacts of 
      V. opulus extracts on sortase A (SrtA) activity (Fluorimetric Assay), staphylococcal 
      protein A (SpA) expression (FITC-labelled specific antibodies), the lipid 
      composition of bacterial cell membranes (LC-MS/MS, GC/MS), and biofilm formation 
      (LIVE/DEAD BacLight) were assessed. The cytotoxicity of V. opulus extracts to the 
      human fibroblast line HFF-1 was also tested (MTT reduction). V. opulus extracts 
      strongly inhibited SrtA activity and SpA expression, caused modifications of S. 
      aureus cell membrane, limited biofilm formation by staphylococci, and were 
      non-cytotoxic. Therefore, they have pro-health potential. Nevertheless, their 
      usefulness as diet supplements that are beneficial for the prevention of 
      staphylococcal infections should be confirmed in animal models in the future.

TI  - Effect of Adiantum philippense Extract on Biofilm Formation, Adhesion With Its 
      Antibacterial Activities Against Foodborne Pathogens, and Characterization of 
      Bioactive Metabolites: An in vitro-in silico Approach.
PG  - 823
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00823 [doi]
LID - 823
AB  - Adiantum philippense (A. philippense), an ethnomedicinally important fern, has 
      become an interesting herb in the search for novel bioactive metabolites, which can 
      also be used as therapeutic agents. Primarily, in this study, A. philippense crude 
      extract was screened for its phytochemical constituents, antagonistic potential, and 
      effect on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation against common food pathogens. 
      Phytochemical profiling of A. philippense was carried out by using High 
      Resolution-Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy (HR-LCMS) followed by 
      antibacterial activity via agar cup/well diffusion, broth microdilution 
      susceptibility methods, and growth curve analysis. Antibiofilm potency and efficacy 
      were assessed on the development, formation, and texture of biofilms through light 
      microscopy, fluorescent microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and the assessment 
      of exopolysaccharide production. Correspondingly, a checkerboard test was performed 
      to evaluate the combinatorial effect of A. philippense and chloramphenicol. Lastly, 
      molecular docking studies of identified phytochemicals with adhesin proteins of 
      tested food pathogens, which helps the bacteria in surface attachment and leads to 
      biofilm formation, were assessed. A. philippense crude extract was found to be 
      active against all tested food pathogens, displaying the rapid time-dependent 
      kinetics of bacterial killing. A. philippense crude extract also impedes the biofilm 
      matrix by reducing the total content of exopolysaccharide, and, likewise, the 
      microscopic images revealed a great extent of disruption in the architecture of 
      biofilms. A synergy was observed between A. philippense crude extract and 
      chloramphenicol for E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa, whereas an additive 
      effect was observed for S. flexneri. Various bioactive phytochemicals were 
      categorized from A. philippense crude extract using HR-LCMS. The molecular docking 
      of these identified phytochemicals was interrelated with the active site residues of 
      adhesin proteins, IcsA, Sortase A, OprD, EspA, and FimH from S. flexneri, S. aureus, 
      P. aeruginosa, and E. coli, respectively. Thus, our findings represent the 
      bioactivity and potency of A. philippense crude extract against food pathogens not 
      only in their planktonic forms but also against/in biofilms for the first time. We 
      have also correlated these findings with the possible mechanism of biofilm 
      inhibition via targeting adhesin proteins, which could be explored further to design 
      new bioactive compounds against biofilm producing foodborne bacterial pathogens.

AB  - In radioimmunotherapy, the contrast between tumor and normal tissue can be improved 
      by using a pretargeting strategy with a primary targeting agent, which is conjugated 
      to a recognition tag, and a secondary radiolabeled molecule binding specifically to 
      the recognition tag. The secondary molecule is injected after the targeting agent 
      has accumulated in the tumor and is designed to have a favorable biodistribution 
      profile, with fast clearance from blood and low uptake in normal tissues. In this 
      study, we have designed and evaluated two complementary peptide nucleic acid 
      (PNA)-based probes for specific and high-affinity association in vivo. An anti-HER2 
      Affibody-PNA chimera, Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1, was produced by a semisynthetic approach 
      using sortase A catalyzed ligation of a recombinantly produced Affibody molecule to 
      a PNA-based HP1-probe assembled using solid-phase chemistry. A complementary HP2 
      probe carrying a DOTA chelator and a tyrosine for dual radiolabeling was prepared by 
      solid-phase synthesis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and UV thermal melts 
      showed that the probes can hybridize to form a structured duplex with a very high 
      melting temperature (T(m)), both in HP1:HP2 and in Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1:HP2 (T(m) = 
      86-88 °C), and the high binding affinity between Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1 and HP2 was 
      confirmed in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based binding study. Following a 
      moderately fast association (1.7 × 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)), the dissociation of the 
      probes was extremely slow and <5% dissociation was observed after 17 h. The 
      equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) for Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1:HP2 binding to HER2 
      was estimated by SPR to be 212 pM, suggesting that the conjugation to PNA does not 
      impair Affibody binding to HER2. The biodistribution profiles of (111)In- and 
      (125)I-labeled HP2 were measured in NMRI mice, showing very fast blood clearance 
      rates and low accumulation of radioactivity in kidneys and other organs. The 
      measured radioactivity in blood was 0.63 ± 0.15 and 0.41 ± 0.15%ID/g for (125)I- and 
      (111)In-HP2, respectively, at 1 h p.i., and at 4 h p.i., the kidney accumulation of 
      radioactivity was 0.17 ± 0.04%ID/g for (125)I-HP2 and 3.83 ± 0.39%ID/g for 
      (111)In-HP2. Taken together, the results suggest that a PNA-based system has 
      suitable biophysical and in vivo properties and is a promising approach for 
      pretargeting of Affibody molecules.

TI  - Site-specific protein labeling with amine-containing molecules using Lactobacillus 
      plantarum sortase.
PG  - 642-8
LID - 10.1002/biot.201100213 [doi]
AB  - Modification of proteins with small molecules is a widely used and powerful tool in 
      biological research. Enzymatic approaches are particularly promising because 
      substrate specificity allows for site-specific modification. Sortase A, a 
      transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus, cleaves between the T and G residues in 
      the sequence LPXTG, and subsequently links the carboxyl group of the T residue to an 
      amino group of N-terminal glycine oligomers by a native peptide bond. Although 
      Gram-positive bacteria have several kinds of sortases, there are few reports 
      concerning their expression and substrate specificity. Here, we demonstrate 
      site-specific protein modification with primary amine-containing molecules catalyzed 
      by Lactobacillus plantarum sortase. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was 
      employed as a model protein, and an amine-containing biotin molecule was 
      site-specifically conjugated with LPQTSEQ-tagged EGFP. We developed a novel 
      Lactobacillus plantarum sortase that has different substrate specificity compared to 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase. Amine-directed protein modification was achieved 
      using the Lactobacillus plantarum sortase ''LPQTSEQ'' sequence original recognition 
      tag. Our results demonstrate a promising method for expanding the capabilities of 
      site-specific protein-small molecule modification.

LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.03.013 [doi]
AB  - We have examined the potential of displaying a protease species in vitro using 
      ribosome display and demonstrate specific capture on the basis of its catalytic 
      activity. Using a model bacterial cysteine protease, sortase A (SrtA), we show that 
      this enzyme can be functionally expressed in vitro. By overlap PCR we constructed 
      ribosome display templates with the SrtA open reading frame fused to a C terminal 
      glycine-serine rich flexible linker and a tether derived from eGFP. Using the broad 
      range cysteine protease irreversible inhibitor E-64 linked to acrylic beads, we show 
      that we can isolate SrtA ribosome display ternary complexes, and recover their 
      encoding mRNA by RT-PCR. This recovery was lost when applied to a SrtA catalytically 
      inactive mutant, or could be alleviated by competition with free inhibitor. This 
      sensitive technique could be further developed to allow the screening of proteases 
      against putative inhibitors and/or the identification of novel proteolytic species.

TI  - Bis(indole) alkaloids as sortase A inhibitors from the sponge Spongosorites sp.
PG  - 4927-31
AB  - A new bis(indole) alkaloid (9) of the hamacanthin class along with the previously 
      reported compounds of the related structural classes, topsentin class (1-4) and 
      hamacanthin class (5-8), was isolated from the marine sponge Spongosorites sp. and 
      their inhibitory activities toward sortase A (SrtA) that play key roles in cell-wall 
      protein anchoring and virulence in Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. Our studies 
      have identified a series of SrtA inhibitors, providing the basis for further 
      development of potent inhibitors. The preliminary structure-activity relationship, 
      to elucidate the essential structural requirements, has been described. The 
      fibronectin-binding activity data highlight the potential of these compounds for the 
      treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of SrtA activity.

PG  - 440-4
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.04.113 [doi]
AB  - Sortase enzymes belong to a family of transpeptidases found in Gram-positive 
      bacteria. Sortase is responsible for the reaction that anchors surface protein 
      virulence factors to the peptidoglycan cell wall of the bacteria. The compound 
      (Z)-3-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) acrylonitrile (DMMA) has previously 
      been reported as a novel sortase inhibitor in vitro, but the in vivo effects of DMMA 
      have not been studied. Here, we evaluated the in vivo effects of DMMA against 
      infection by wild-type and sortase A- and/or sortase B-deficient Staphylococcus 
      aureus in Balb/c mice. With DMMA treatment, survival rates increased and kidney and 
      joint infection rates decreased (p<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. The rate of 
      kidney infection was significantly reduced in the mice treated with sortase A 
      knock-out S. aureus (p<0.01). These results indicate that by acting as a potent 
      inhibitor of sortase A and moderate inhibitor of sortase B, DMMA can decrease kidney 
      and joint infection rates and reduce mortality in mice infected with S. aureus. 
      These findings suggest that DMMA is a promising therapeutic compound against 
      Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Site-specific C-terminal dinitrophenylation to reconstitute the antibody Fc 
      functions for nanobodies.
PG  - 9331-9338
LID - 10.1039/c9sc03840j [doi]
AB  - Nanobodies are a class of camelid-derived single-domain antibodies that have many 
      potential advantages over conventional antibodies and have been utilized to develop 
      new therapeutic strategies for cancer and other diseases. However, nanobodies lack 
      the Fc region of a conventional antibody, which possesses many functions, e.g., 
      eliciting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
      cytotoxicity (CDC), essential for effective immunotherapy. The small molecular size 
      of nanobodies also leads to poor pharmacokinetics, such as short in vivo half-life. 
      To address these deficiencies, an endogenous antibody-based strategy to reconstitute 
      the Fc functions for nanobodies was developed. As a proof-of-principle, an 
      anti-human EGFR nanobody, 7D12, was selected to conduct C-terminal modification with 
      the dinitrophenyl (DNP) hapten through Sortase A-mediated site-specific ligation. It 
      was expected that the DNP motif would recruit endogenous human anti-DNP antibodies 
      to indirectly reinstate the Fc functions. The resultant nanobody-DNP conjugates were 
      shown to exhibit specific and high affinity binding to human EGFR expressed on 
      target cancer cells. It was further proved that in the presence of anti-DNP 
      antibody, these conjugates could mediate potent ADCC and CDC in vitro and exhibit 
      significantly elongated half-life in vivo. Ultimately, it was proven in severe 
      combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice that treatment with the nanobody 7D12-DNP 
      conjugate and anti-DNP mouse serum could inhibit xenograft tumor growth efficiently. 
      In view of the abundance of anti-DNP and other endogenous antibodies in the human 
      blood system, this could be a generally applicable approach employed to reconstitute 
      the Fc functions for nanobodies and develop nanobody-based cancer immunotherapy and 
      other therapies.

TI  - Enhanced pyruvate production in Candida glabrata by carrier engineering.
PG  - 473-482
LID - 10.1002/bit.26477 [doi]
AB  - Pyruvate is an important organic acid that plays a key role in the central metabolic 
      pathway. Manipulating transporters is an efficient strategy to enhance production of 
      target organic acids and a means to understand the effects of altered intracellular 
      pyruvate content on global metabolic networks. Efforts have been made to manipulate 
      mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) to transport pyruvate into different 
      subcellular compartments in Candida glabrata to demonstrate the effects of the 
      subcellular distribution of pyruvate on central carbon metabolism. By increasing the 
      mitochondrial pyruvate content through enhancing the rate of pyruvate transport into 
      mitochondria, a high central carbon metabolism rate, specific growth rate and 
      specific pyruvate production rate were obtained. Comparing the intracellular 
      pyruvate content of engineered and control strains showed that higher intracellular 
      pyruvate levels were not conducive to improving pyruvate productivity or central 
      carbon metabolism. Plasma membrane expression of MPCs significantly increased the 
      expression levels of key rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes. Moreover, pyruvate 
      production of CGΔura3-Sp-MPC1, CGΔura3-Sp-MPC2, and CGΔura3-Sp-MPC1-Sp-MPC2 
      increased 134.4%, 120.3%, and 30.0%, respectively. In conclusion, lower 
      intracellular pyruvate content enhanced central carbon metabolism and provided 
      useful clues for improving the production of other organic acids in microorganisms.

TI  - Sortase anchored proteins of Streptococcus uberis play major roles in the 
      pathogenesis of bovine mastitis in dairy cattle.
PG  - 63

LID - 63
AB  - Streptococcus uberis, strain 0140J, contains a single copy sortase A (srtA), 
      encoding a transamidase capable of covalently anchoring specific proteins to 
      peptidoglycan. Unlike the wild-type, an isogenic mutant carrying an inactivating 
      ISS1 insertion within srtA was only able to infect the bovine mammary gland in a 
      transient fashion. For the first 24 h post challenge, the srtA mutant colonised at a 
      similar rate and number to the wild type strain, but unlike the wild type did not 
      subsequently colonise in higher numbers. Similar levels of host cell infiltration 
      were detected in response to infection with both strains, but only in those mammary 
      quarters infected with the wild type strain were clinical signs of disease evident. 
      Mutants that failed to express individual sortase substrate proteins (sub0135, 
      sub0145, sub0207, sub0241, sub0826, sub0888, sub1095, sub1154, sub1370, and sub1730) 
      were isolated and their virulence determined in the same challenge model. This 
      revealed that mutants lacking sub0145, sub1095 and sub1154 were attenuated in 
      cattle. These data demonstrate that a number of sortase anchored proteins each play 
      a distinct, non-redundant and important role in pathogenesis of S. uberis infection 
      within the lactating bovine mammary gland.

TI  - Site-specific protein modification on living cells catalyzed by Sortase.
PG  - 802-7
LID - 10.1002/cbic.200700614 [doi]
AB  - The use of enzymes is a promising approach for site-specific protein modification on 
      living cells owing to their substrate specificity. Herein we describe a general 
      strategy for the site-specific modification of cell surface proteins with synthetic 
      molecules by using Sortase, a transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus. The short 
      peptide tag LPETGG is genetically introduced to the C terminus of the target 
      protein, expressed on the cell surface. Subsequent addition of Sortase and an 
      N-terminal triglycine-containing probe results in the site-specific labeling of the 
      tagged protein. We were successful in the C-terminal-specific labeling of osteoclast 
      differentiation factor (ODF) with a biotin- or fluorophore-containing short peptide 
      on the living cell surface. The labeling reaction occurred efficiently in 
      serum-containing medium, as well as serum-free medium or PBS. The labeled products 
      were detected after incubation for 5 min. In addition, site-specific protein-protein 
      conjugation was successfully demonstrated on a living cell surface by the 
      Sortase-catalyzed reaction. This strategy provides a powerful tool for cell biology 
      and cell surface engineering.

      using a combination of enzyme-mediated bioconjugation and click chemistry.
PG  - 7515-9
LID - 10.1002/anie.201411507 [doi]
AB  - A unique two-step modular system for site-specific antibody modification and 
      conjugation is reported. The first step of this approach uses enzymatic 
      bioconjugation with the transpeptidase Sortase A for incorporation of strained 
      cyclooctyne functional groups. The second step of this modular approach involves the 
      azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction. The versatility of the two-step approach 
      has been exemplified by the selective incorporation of fluorescent dyes and a 
      positron-emitting copper-64 radiotracer for fluorescence and positron-emission 
      tomography imaging of activated platelets, platelet aggregates, and thrombi, 
      respectively. This flexible and versatile approach could be readily adapted to 
      incorporate a large array of tailor-made functional groups using reliable click 
      chemistry whilst preserving the activity of the antibody or other sensitive 
      biological macromolecules.

TI  - Identification of novel LPXTG-linked surface proteins from Streptococcus gordonii.
PG  - 1977-1988
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.027854-0 [doi]
AB  - Surface adhesion plays an essential part in the survival of the commensal organism 
      Streptococcus gordonii in the oral cavity as well as during opportunistic infections 
      such as endocarditis. At least two types of cell surface protein involved in 
      adhesion are found on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria: those anchored via an 
      LPXTG motif by the enzyme sortase A (SrtA) and those associated with the cell 
      surface by, as yet, unknown mechanisms. In srtA(-) mutants, LPXTG-containing 
      proteins have been shown to be released rather than cross-linked to the cell wall. 
      We have therefore used 2D gel electrophoresis of released proteins from an srtA(-) 
      mutant as well as the wild-type strain, followed by peptide identification by MS, to 
      identify a set of novel proteins predicted to be present on the surface of S. 
      gordonii DL1. This includes two large LPXTG-linked proteins (SGO_0707 and SGO_1487), 
      which both contain tandemly repeated sequences similar to those present in known 
      fibrillar adhesins. A 5'-nucleotidase and a protein with a putative collagen-binding 
      domain, both containing LPXTG motifs, were also identified. Anchorless proteins with 
      known chaperone, stress response and elongation factor functions, apparently 
      responsible for bacterial binding to keratinocytes and saliva-coated surfaces in the 
      absence of the LPXTG-linked adhesins, were also associated with the cell surface. 
      These data reveal a range of proteins to be present on the S. gordonii DL1 cell 
      surface, the expression of which plays an important role in adhesion to epithelia 
      and which represent likely candidates for novel virulence factors in S. gordonii.

AB  - The justification for the use of herbal supplements with Pulmonaria officinalis L. 
      extract (POE) in the case of staphylococcal lung colonization/infections 
      characteristic for cystic fibrosis (CF), was examined in vitro. The impact of POE 
      phenolic-rich fraction on the virulence attributes of CF-associated Staphylococcus 
      aureus (S. aureus) clinical strains has been assessed, including pathogen adhesion, 
      biofilm formation on native and protein-conditioned surfaces (mucin, elastin), 
      mature biofilm eradication, staphylococcal protein A expression, α-toxin release, 
      and S. a. adhesion to A549 cells. Cytotoxicity of the extract to lung epithelial 
      cells was also investigated. It was found that POE has bacteriostatic effects at MIC 
      1⁻2 mg/mL, recognized as of limited efficacy, but at MIC/subMICs it targeted 
      virulence not viability. It usually decreased S. aureus adhesion and less frequently 
      inhibited biofilm formation on native and protein-conditioned surfaces. Observed 
      effect seems to be related to significant reduction by POE of sortase A activity. 
      However, in some cases POE favored the creation of biofilm by staphylococci and S. 
      aureus adhesion to the lung epithelium was not limited. On the other side POE caused 
      significant decrease of S. a. α-toxin synthesis and slightly weakened the expression 
      of SpA. When used at supraMICs POE eradicated mature biofilm, but in some cases with 
      unsatisfying outcomes. Promisingly, POE has been recognized as a safe product, with 
      no cytotoxicity up to 4 mg/mL. These results reflect the positive, negative or 
      neutral anti-staphylococcal properties of POE. It seems that POE may be beneficial 
      as a prophylactic, but not as a therapeutic or supportive agent in the area of 
      CF-integrative medicine. However, introduction the official recommendations needs 
      further in vivo studies.

AB  - While conventional antibodies have been an instrument of choice in 
      immunocytochemistry for some time, their small counterparts known as nanobodies have 
      been much less frequently used for this purpose. In this study we took advantage of 
      the availability of nanobody cDNAs to site-specifically introduce a non-standard 
      amino acid carrying an azide/alkyne moiety, allowing subsequent Cu(I)-catalyzed 
      Azide-Alkyne Click Chemistry (CuAAC). This generated a fluorescently labelled 
      nanobody that can be used in single step immunocytochemistry as compared to 
      conventional two step immunocytochemistry. Two strategies were explored to label 
      nanobodies with Alexa Fluor 488. The first involved enzymatic addition of an 
      alkyne-containing peptide to nanobodies using sortase A, while the second consisted 
      of incorporating para-azido phenylalanine at the nanobody C-terminus. Through these 
      approaches, the fluorophore was covalently and site-specifically attached. It was 
      demonstrated that cortactin and β-catenin, cytoskeletal and adherens junction 
      proteins respectively, can be imaged in cells in this manner through single step 
      immunocytochemistry. However, fixation and permeabilization of cells can alter 
      native protein structure and form a dense cross-linked protein network, encumbering 
      antibody binding. It was shown that photoporation prior to fixation not only allowed 
      delivery of nanobodies into living cells, but also facilitated β-catenin nanobody 
      Nb86 imaging of its target, which was not possible in fixed cells. Pharmacological 
      inhibitors are lacking for many non-enzymatic proteins, and it is therefore expected 
      that new biological information will be obtained through photoporation of 
      fluorescent nanobodies, which allows the study of short term effects, independent of 
      gene-dependent (intrabody) expression.

TI  - Inhibition of sortase-mediated Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to fibronectin via 
      fibronectin-binding protein by sortase inhibitors.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - The sortase enzymes are a family of Gram-positive transpeptidases responsible for 
      anchoring surface protein virulence factors to the peptidoglycan cell wall layer. In 
      Staphylococcus aureus, deletion of the sortase isoforms results in marked reduction 
      in virulence and infection potential, making it an important antivirulence target. 
      Recombinant sortase A (SrtA) and sortase B (SrtB) were incubated with peptide 
      substrate containing either the LPETG or NPQTN motifs. 
      (Z)-3-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) acrylonitrile, 
      beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside, berberine chloride, and psammaplin A1 showed 
      potent inhibitory activity against SrtA and SrtB. These compounds also exhibited 
      potent inhibitory activity against S. aureus cell adhesion to fibronectin. The 
      fibronectin-binding activity data highlight the potential of these compounds for the 
      treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of sortase activity.

TI  - Visualization of the pH-dependent dynamic distribution of G2A in living cells.

AB  - G2A (from G2 accumulation) receptor is a member of the proton-sensing G-protein 
      coupled receptor (GPCR) family and induces signal transduction events that regulate 
      the cell cycle, proliferation, oncogenesis, and immunity. The mechanism by which 
      G2A-mediated signal transduction is regulated by the extracellular pH remains 
      unresolved. Here, we first visualize the pH-dependent G2A distribution change in 
      living cells by a sortase A-mediated pulse labeling technology: the short-peptide 
      tag-fused human G2A on human embryo kidney HEK293T cell surfaces was labeled with a 
      small fluorescent dye in the presence of lysophosphatidylcholine, and the labeled 
      G2A was chased at acidic and neutral pHs in real time by microscope time course 
      observations. G2A internalization from cell surfaces into intracellular compartments 
      was observed to be inhibited under acidic pH conditions, and this inhibition was 
      relieved at neutral pH. Additionally, the internalized G2A was redistributed onto 
      cell surfaces by jumping from a neutral to an acidic pH. From quantitative image 
      analysis data, we conclude the amount of G2A on the cell surface was controlled by 
      suppressing the G2A internalization rate by one-tenth in response to the 
      extracellular acidic pH, and this acidic pH-induced G2A accumulation on cell 
      surfaces may be explained by proton-induced dissociation of G2A from endocytic 
      machinery.

AB  - G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in many diseases and important 
      biological phenomena; elucidating the mechanisms underlying regulation of their 
      signal transduction potentially provides both novel targets for drug discovery and 
      insight into living systems. A proton-sensing GPCR, ovarian cancer G protein-coupled 
      receptor 1 (OGR1), has been reported to be related to acidosis and diseases that 
      cause tissue acidification, but the mechanism of proton-induced activation of 
      OGR1-mediated signal transduction in acidic conditions remains unclear. Here, 
      pH-dependent intracellular trafficking of OGR1 was visualized in living leukocytes 
      by a real-time fluorescence microscopic method based on sortase A-mediated pulse 
      labeling of OGR1. OGR1 labeled on the cell surface with a small fluorescent dye was 
      clearly observed to remain in the plasma membrane during incubation in mildly acidic 
      medium (pH 6.6) and to be internalized to the intracellular compartments on changing 
      the medium to slightly basic pH (7.7). Quantitative single-cell image analysis 
      showed that most of the internalized OGR1s were then recycled to the plasma membrane 
      for signal transduction if the extracellular pH was returned to the mildly acidic 
      state. However, in a minor population of cells (40%), the internalized OGR1s were 
      retained in endosomes or transported to lysosomes and degraded, leading to low 
      efficiency of their recycling to the plasma membrane. Thus, the present live-cell 
      monitoring strongly suggests that the signal transduction activity of OGR1 is 
      regulated by pH-dependent internalization and recycling to the plasma membrane.

TI  - The Streptococcos suis sortases SrtB and SrtF are essential for disease in pigs.
PG  - 163-173
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000752 [doi]
AB  - The porcine pathogen Streptococcus suis colonizes the upper respiratory tracts of 
      pigs, potentially causing septicaemia, meningitis and death, thus placing a severe 
      burden on the agricultural industry worldwide. It is also a zoonotic pathogen that 
      is known to cause systemic infections and meningitis in humans. Understanding how S. 
      suis colonizes and interacts with its hosts is relevant for future strategies of 
      drug and vaccine development. As with other Gram-positive bacteria, S. suis utilizes 
      enzymes known as sortases to attach specific proteins bearing cell wall sorting 
      signals to its surface, where they can play a role in host-pathogen interactions. 
      The surface proteins of bacteria are often important in adhesion to and invasion of 
      host cells. In this study, markerless in-frame deletion mutants of the housekeeping 
      sortase srtA and the two pilus-associated sortases, srtB and srtF, were generated 
      and their importance in S. suis infections was investigated. We found that all three 
      of these sortases are essential to disease in pigs, concluding that their 
      cognate-sorted proteins may also be useful in protecting pigs against infection.

TI  - A potential new pathway for Staphylococcus aureus dissemination: the silent survival 
      of S. aureus phagocytosed by human monocyte-derived macrophages.
PG  - e1409
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0001409 [doi]
LID - e1409
AB  - Although considered to be an extracellular pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus is able 
      to invade a variety of mammalian, non-professional phagocytes and can also survive 
      engulfment by professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes. In both of 
      these cell types S. aureus promptly escapes from the endosomes/phagosomes and 
      proliferates within the cytoplasm, which quickly leads to host cell death. In this 
      report we show that S. aureus interacted with human monocyte-derived macrophages in 
      a very different way to those of other mammalian cells. Upon phagocytosis by 
      macrophages, S. aureus persisted intracellularly in vacuoles for 3-4 days before 
      escaping into the cytoplasm and causing host cell lysis. Until the point of host 
      cell lysis the infected macrophages showed no signs of apoptosis or necrosis and 
      were functional. They were able to eliminate intracellular staphylococci if 
      prestimulated with interferon-gamma at concentrations equivalent to human 
      therapeutic doses. S. aureus survival was dependent on the alternative sigma factor 
      B as well as the global regulator agr, but not SarA. Furthermore, isogenic mutants 
      deficient in alpha-toxin, the metalloprotease aureolysin, protein A, and sortase A 
      were efficiently killed by macrophages upon phagocytosis, although with different 
      kinetics. In particular alpha-toxin was a key effector molecule that was essential 
      for S. aureus intracellular survival in macrophages. Together, our data indicate 
      that the ability of S. aureus to survive phagocytosis by macrophages is determined 
      by multiple virulence factors in a way that differs considerably from its 
      interactions with other cell types. S. aureus persists inside macrophages for 
      several days without affecting the viability of these mobile cells which may serve 
      as vehicles for the dissemination of infection.

TI  - A coagulase-negative and non-haemolytic strain of Staphylococcus aureus for 
      investigating the roles of SrtA in a murine model of bloodstream infection.
PG  - ftv042
LID - ftv042 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femspd/ftv042 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a cysteine transpeptidase and virulence factor from 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) that catalyses the attachment and display of 
      surface proteins on the cell wall, thereby mediating bacterial adhesion to host 
      tissues, host-cell entry and evasion of the immune response. As a result, SrtA has 
      become an important target in the development of therapies for S. aureus infections. 
      In this study, we used the new reference strain S. aureus Newman D2C to investigate 
      the role of SrtA in a murine model of bloodstream infection, when the impact of 
      coagulase and haemolysin is excluded. The results suggested that deletion of SrtA 
      reduced the bacterial burden on the heart, liver and kidneys by blunting the host 
      proinflammatory cytokine response at an early point in infection. Kidneys, but not 
      heart or liver, formed abscesses on the sixth day following non-lethal infection, 
      and this effect was diminished by SrtA mutation. These findings indicate that SrtA 
      is a determining virulence factor in lethality and formation of renal abscesses in 
      mice followed by S. aureus bloodstream infection. We have thus established a 
      convenient in vitro and mouse model for developing SrtA-targeted therapeutic 
      strategies.

TI  - Role of Lactobacillus reuteri cell and mucus-binding protein A (CmbA) in adhesion to 
      intestinal epithelial cells and mucus in vitro.
PG  - 671-681
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.073551-0 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri, a symbiotic inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract in 
      humans and animals, is marketed as a probiotic. The ability to adhere to intestinal 
      epithelial cells and mucus is an interesting property with regard to probiotic 
      features such as colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and interaction with the 
      host. Here, we present a study performed to elucidate the role of sortase (SrtA), 
      four putative sortase-dependent proteins (SDPs), and one C-terminal 
      membrane-anchored cell surface protein of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 in 
      adhesion to Caco-2 cells and mucus in vitro. This included mutagenesis of the genes 
      encoding these proteins and complementation of mutants. A null mutation in 
      hmpref0536_10255 encoding srtA resulted in significantly reduced adhesion to Caco-2 
      cells and mucus, indicating involvement of SDPs in adhesion. Evaluation of the 
      bacterial adhesion revealed that of the five putative surface protein mutants 
      tested, only a null mutation in the hmpref0536_10633 gene, encoding a putative SDP 
      with an LPxTG motif, resulted in a significant loss of adhesion to both Caco-2 cells 
      and mucus. Complementation with the functional gene on a plasmid restored adhesion 
      to Caco-2 cells. However, complete restoration of adhesion to mucus was not 
      achieved. Overexpression of hmpref0536_10633 in strain ATCC PTA 6475 resulted in an 
      increased adhesion to Caco-2 cells and mucus compared with the WT strain. We 
      conclude from these results that, among the putative surface proteins tested, the 
      protein encoded by hmpref0536_10633 plays a critical role in binding of 
      Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 to Caco-2 cells and mucus. Based on this, we 
      propose that this LPxTG motif containing protein should be referred to as cell and 
      mucus binding protein A (CmbA).

AB  - Recently, the fabrication of protein bilayer has been required for the development 
      of protein or enzyme complex formation. In the present study, we fabricated a fusion 
      protein bilayer composed of recombinant azurin-cytochrome P450, which was 
      synthesized by a site-specific sortase-mediated ligation method. The Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa azurin was modified by DNA recombinant technique, for enzymatic ligation 
      and immobilization. The Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450 was also modified for 
      enzymatic ligation. The recombinant metalloproteins were conjugated via the sortase 
      A. The conjugation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and UV-vis. Then, the prepared fusion 
      protein was immobilized on Au substrate, by the self-assembly method. The Azu-P450 
      (recombinant azurin-cytochrome P450) fusion protein layer was confirmed by AFM 
      (Atomic Force Microscopy) and SERS (Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy), to confirm 
      the fusion protein bilayer orientation. Moreover, the electrochemical property of 
      Azu-P450 was observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As a result, the Azu-P450 fusion 
      protein bilayer shows good orientation on the Au substrate. Also, the original redox 
      property of this fusion protein bilayer has been well maintained. The proposed 
      fusion protein bilayer can.

AB  - Cell-surface display of functional proteins is a powerful and useful tool for 
      regulating and reinforcing cellular functions. Direct incorporation of 
      site-specifically lipidated proteins from the extracellular medium is more rapid, 
      easily controllable and reliable in displaying active proteins than expression 
      through gene transfer. However, undesirable amphiphilic reagents such as organic 
      co-solvents and detergents were required for suppressing aggregation of ordinary 
      lipidated proteins in solution. We report here sortase A-catalyzed modification of 
      proteins with a poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)-lipid in situ on the surface of living 
      cells. Proteins fused with a recognition tag were site-specifically ligated with the 
      PEG-lipid which was preliminary incorporated into cell membranes. Accordingly, 
      target proteins were successfully displayed on living cells without aggregation 
      under an amphiphilic reagent-free condition. Furthermore, to demonstrate the 
      availability of the present method, Fc domains of immunoglobulin G were displayed on 
      cancer cells, and the phagocytosis of cancer cells with dendritic cells were 
      enhanced through the Fc-Fc receptor interaction. Thus, the present facile 
      chemoenzymatic method for protein display can be utilized for modulating cell-cell 
      interactions in cell and tissue engineering fields.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus Panton-Valentine leukocidin is a pore-forming toxin targeting 
      the human C5a receptor (hC5aR), enabling this pathogen to battle the immune response 
      by destroying phagocytes through targeted lysis. The mechanisms that contribute to 
      rapid cell lysis are largely unexplored. Here, we show that cell lysis may be 
      enabled by a process of toxins targeting receptor clusters and present indirect 
      evidence for receptor "recycling" that allows multiple toxin pores to be formed 
      close together. With the use of live cell single-molecule super-resolution imaging, 
      Förster resonance energy transfer and nanoscale total internal reflection 
      fluorescence colocalization microscopy, we visualized toxin pore formation in the 
      presence of its natural docking ligand. We demonstrate disassociation of hC5aR from 
      toxin complexes and simultaneous binding of new ligands. This effect may free mobile 
      receptors to amplify hyperinflammatory reactions in early stages of microbial 
      infections and have implications for several other similar bicomponent toxins and 
      the design of new antibiotics.-Haapasalo, K., Wollman, A. J. M., de Haas, C. J. C.,

TI  - Production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli using an N-terminal tag 
      derived from sortase.
PG  - 143-50
LID - 10.1016/j.pep.2009.10.012 [doi]
AB  - The use of Escherichia coli protein expression systems has many benefits, including 
      the ease of propagation, amounts of protein that can be generated and cost. However, 
      this host has some drawbacks due to difficulties in the production of soluble 
      foreign proteins with their alternate codon usage bias, reductive cytoplasmic 
      environment and lack of complex post-translational modifications. We have designed a 
      novel fusion protein tag derived from the sequence of sortase (SrtA) which we have 
      named Solubility 'eNhancing'Ubiquitous Tag (SNUT). Here we demonstrate its 
      application and effectiveness as an N-terminal fusion tag for the expression and 
      purification of proteins that could not be effectively produced with other tags. We 
      show this tag can be utilized for the purification of proteins through both native 
      and refolding immobilized metal ion chromatography and in combination with an 
      anti-SNUT monoclonal antibody, can also be used as a detection tag. This tag may 
      prove useful in circumventing expression and purification issues with the production 
      of proteins in bacterial expression hosts.
