AB  - Sortase A, a transpeptidase enzyme is present in many Gram-positive bacteria and 
      helps in the recruitment of the cell surface proteins. Over the last two decades, 
      Sortase A has become an attractive tool for performing in vivo and in vitro 
      ligations. Sortase A-mediated ligation has continuously been used for its 
      specificity, robustness, and highly efficient nature. These properties make it a 
      popular choice among protein engineers as well as researchers from different fields. 
      In this review, we give an overview of Sortase A-mediated ligation of various 
      molecules on the cell surfaces, which can have diverse applications in 
      interdisciplinary fields.

AB  - Virulence factor, sortase A (SrtA), has crucial roles in the pathogenesis of 
      Gram-positive superbugs. SrtA is a bacterial cell membrane enzyme that anchors 
      crucial virulence factors to the cell wall surface of Gram-positive bacteria. SrtA 
      is not necessary for bacterial growth and viability and is conveniently accessible 
      in the cell membrane; therefore, it is an ideal target for antivirulence drug 
      development. In this review, we focus on antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-expressing 
      bacteria and SrtA as a potential target for overcoming AMR. The mechanism of action 
      of SrtA and its inhibition by various types of inhibitors, such as synthetic small 
      molecules, peptides, and natural products, are provided. Future SrtA research 
      perspectives for alternative drug development to antibiotics are also proposed.

AB  - Molecular biologists and chemists alike have long sought to modify proteins with 
      substituents that cannot be installed by standard or even advanced genetic 
      approaches. We here describe the use of transpeptidases to achieve these goals. 
      Living systems encode a variety of transpeptidases and peptide ligases that allow 
      for the enzyme-catalyzed formation of peptide bonds, and protein engineers have used 
      directed evolution to enhance these enzymes for biological applications. We focus 
      primarily on the transpeptidase sortase A, which has become popular over the past 
      few years for its ability to perform a remarkably wide variety of protein 
      modifications, both in vitro and in living cells.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. The 
      enzyme sortase A, present on the cell surface of S. aureus, plays a key role in 
      bacterial virulence without affecting the bacterial viability. Inhibition of sortase 
      A activity offers a powerful but clinically less explored therapeutic strategy, as 
      it offers the possibility of not inducing any selective pressure on the bacteria to 
      evolve drug-resistant strains. In this Perspective, we offer a chemical space 
      narrative for the design of sortase A inhibitors, as delineated into three broad 
      domains: peptidomimetics, natural products, and synthetic small molecules. This 
      provides immense opportunities for medicinal chemists to alleviate the ever-growing 
      crisis of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Epitope-specific enzymes are powerful tools for site-specific protein modification 
      but generally require genetic manipulation of the target protein. Here, we describe 
      the laboratory evolution of the bacterial transpeptidase sortase A to recognize the 
      LMVGG sequence in endogenous amyloid-β (Aβ) protein. Using a yeast display selection 
      for covalent bond formation, we evolved a sortase variant that prefers LMVGG 
      substrates from a starting enzyme that prefers LPESG substrates, resulting in a 
      >1,400-fold change in substrate preference. We used this evolved sortase to label 
      endogenous Aβ in human cerebrospinal fluid, enabling the detection of Aβ with 
      sensitivities rivaling those of commercial assays. The evolved sortase can conjugate 
      a hydrophilic peptide to Aβ(42), greatly impeding the ability of the resulting 
      protein to aggregate into higher-order structures. These results demonstrate 
      laboratory evolution of epitope-specific enzymes toward endogenous targets as a 
      strategy for site-specific protein modification without target gene manipulation and 
      enable potential future applications of sortase-mediated labeling of Aβ peptides.

      13-amino acid-long peptide substrate of sortase A is conjugated to SiO(2)-EDTA-Gd 
      NPs. In the presence of sortase A, the LPXTG motif on the peptide strand is cleaved 
      resulting in a shortened peptide as well as a reduced water T(2) value whose 
      magnitude is dependent on the concentration of sortase A. The detection limit is 
      determined to be 76 pM. In contrast, the presence of sortase A inhibitors causes the 
      T(2) to remain at a higher value. The proposed method is used to characterize 
      inhibition of sortase A by curcumin and 4-(hydroxymercuri)benzoic acid with an 
      IC(50) value of 12.9 ± 1.6 μM and 130 ± 1.76 μM, respectively. Furthermore, this 
      method was successfully applied to detect sortase A activity in bacterial 
      suspensions. The feasibility to screen different inhibitors in Escherichia coli and 
      S. aureus suspensions was demonstrated. This method is fast and potentially useful 
      to rapidly screen possible inhibitors of sortase A in bacterial suspensions, thereby 
      aiding in the development of antibacterial agents targeting Gram-positive bacteria.

AB  - Sortase A is a membrane enzyme responsible for the anchoring of surface-exposed 
      proteins to the cell wall envelope of Gram-positive bacteria. As a well-studied 
      member of the sortase subfamily catalysing the cell wall anchoring of important 
      virulence factors to the surface of staphylococci, enterococci and streptococci, 
      sortase A plays a critical role in Gram-positive bacterial pathogenesis. It is thus 
      considered a promising target for the development of new anti-infective drugs that 
      aim to interfere with important Gram-positive virulence mechanisms, such as adhesion 
      to host tissues, evasion of host defences, and biofilm formation. The additional 
      properties of sortase A as an enzyme that is not required for Gram-positive 
      bacterial growth or viability and is conveniently located on the cell membrane 
      making it more accessible to inhibitor targeting, constitute additional reasons 
      reinforcing the view that sortase A is an ideal target for anti-virulence drug 
      development. Many inhibitors of sortase A have been identified to date using 
      high-throughput or in silico screening of compound libraries (synthetic or natural), 
      and while many have proved useful tools for probing the action model of the enzyme, 
      several are also promising candidates for the development into potent inhibitors. 
      This review is focused on the most promising sortase A inhibitor compounds that are 
      currently in development as leads towards a new class of anti-infective drugs that 
      are urgently needed to help combat the alarming increase in antimicrobial 
      resistance.

AB  - The bacterial ligase Sortase A (SA) and its mutated variants have become 
      increasingly popular over the last years for post-translational protein 
      modifications due to their unparalleled specificity and efficiency. The aim of this 
      work was to study SA as a cross-linking enzyme for hydrogel-based tissue 
      engineering. For this, we optimized SA pentamutant production and purification from 
      E. coli to achieve high yields and purity. Then using hyaluronan (HA) as a model 
      biopolymer and modifying it with SA-substrate peptides, we studied the cross-linking 
      kinetics obtained with SA, the enzyme stability, cytocompatibility, and 
      immunogenicity, and compared those to state-of-the-art standards. The 
      transglutaminase activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) was used as the reference 
      cross-linking enzyme, and the clinical collagen scaffold Chondro-Gide (CG) was used 
      as a reference biocompatible material for in vivo studies. We found SA could be 
      produced in large amounts in the lab without special equipment, whereas the only 
      viable source of FXIIIa is currently a prescription medicine purified from donated 
      blood. SA was also remarkably more stable in solution than FXIIIa, and it could 
      provide even much faster gelation, making it possible to achieve 
      nearly-instantaneous gel formation upon delivery with a double-barrel syringe. This 
      is an interesting improvement for in vivo work, to allow in situ gel formation in a 
      wet environment, and could also be useful for applications like bioprinting where 
      very fast gelation is needed. The cytocompatibility and lack of immunogenicity were 
      still uncompromised. These results support the use of SA as a versatile enzymatic 
      cross-linking strategy for 3D culture and tissue engineering applications. STATEMENT 
      OF SIGNIFICANCE: Enzymatic crosslinking has immense appeal for tissue engineers as 
      one of the most biocompatible methods of hydrogel crosslinking. Sortase A has a 
      number of unique advantages over previous systems. We show an impressive and tunable 
      range of crosslinking kinetics, from almost instantaneous gelation to several 
      minutes. We also demonstrate that Sortase A crosslinked hydrogels have good 
      cytocompatibility and cause no immune reaction when implanted in vivo. With its 
      additional benefits of excellent stability in solution and easy large-scale 
      synthesis available to any lab, we believe this novel crosslinking modality will 
      find multiple applications in high throughput screening, tissue engineering, and 
      biofabrication.

AB  - Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are highly potent targeted anticancer therapies. 
      They rely on the linking of a selectively targeting antibody moiety with potent 
      cytotoxic payloads to effect antitumoral activity. In recent years, one focus in the 
      ADC field was to create novel methods for site-specifically conjugating payloads to 
      antibodies. The method presented here is based on the S. aureus sortase A-mediated 
      transpeptidation reaction. This method requires antibodies to be engineered in such 
      a way that they possess the sortase recognition pentapeptide motif LPETG on the 
      C-terminus of the immunoglobulin heavy and/or light chains. In addition, the toxin 
      must contain an oligoglycine motif in order to make it a suitable substrate for 
      sortase A. Here we describe a detailed method to conjugate a pentaglycine-modified 
      toxin to the C-termini of LPETG-tagged antibody heavy and light chains using 
      sortase-mediated antibody conjugation (SMAC-Technology™). Highly homogenous, 
      site-specifically conjugated ADCs with controlled drug to antibody ratio and 
      improved overall properties can be obtained with this method.

PG  - 205-13
AB  - Bioactive peptides regulate many physiological processes, acting at some sites as 
      endocrine or paracrine signals and at others as neurotransmitters or growth factors, 
      and show useful properties for human health, including antimicrobial, antifungal, 
      antiviral, and antitumor activities. Although most peptides can be produced using 
      the molecular biology approach, they are produced in limited quantities at high 
      costs and associated with some difficulties in purification and isolation. In 
      addition, some peptides with special structures, such as cyclic peptides, can hardly 
      be produced by the biological method. This is especially true for the biomedical 
      applications in which long peptides with many repeated functional sequences are 
      usually needed. Prokaryotic transpeptidase Sortase A mediates sequence specific 
      peptide ligation and represents a new method for peptide modifications. Besides 
      peptide and protein modifications to improve stability and specificity of 
      therapeutic peptides, Sortase A mediated peptide ligation has been extended to wider 
      applications such as molecular sensing, surface modification, and biomaterials. In 
      this review, we will focus the pharmacological applications of Sortase A for the 
      production of nucleic acid-peptide conjugates, glycosylated peptides, modified 
      proteins/antibodies, and cyclic peptides.

LID - 359
AB  - Seven alkaloidal compounds (2-8) and one polyketide (1) were isolated from a 
      semisolid rice culture of the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus sp. F452. Structures 
      of the isolated compounds were elucidated based on spectroscopic data and 
      comparisons with previously reported data. The alkaloidal compounds (2-8) displayed 
      weak to moderate inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus-derived sortase 
      A (SrtA) without affecting cell viability. Aspermytin A (1) strongly inhibited SrtA 
      activity, with an IC(50) value of 146.0 μM, and significantly reduced bacterial 
      adherence to fibronectin-coated surfaces. The present results indicate that the 
      underlying mechanism of action of compound 1 is associated with the inhibition of 
      SrtA-mediated S. aureus adhesion to fibronectin, thus potentially serving as an SrtA 
      inhibitor.

AB  - The widespread and uncontrollable emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, 
      especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, has promoted a wave of 
      efforts to discover a new generation of antibiotics that prevent or treat bacterial 
      infections neither as bactericides nor bacteriostats. Due to its crucial role in 
      virulence and its nonessentiality in bacterial survival, sortase A has been 
      considered as a great target for new antibiotics. Sortase A inhibitors have emerged 
      as promising alternative antivirulence agents against bacteria. Herein, the 
      structural and preparative aspects of some small synthetic organic compounds that 
      block the pathogenic action of sortase A have been described.

AB  - The ability to routinely generate efficient protein catalysts of bond-forming 
      reactions chosen by researchers, rather than nature, is a long-standing goal of the 
      molecular life sciences. Here, we describe a directed evolution strategy for enzymes 
      that catalyze, in principle, any bond-forming reaction. The system integrates yeast 
      display, enzyme-mediated bioconjugation, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to 
      isolate cells expressing proteins that catalyze the coupling of two substrates 
      chosen by the researcher. We validated the system using model screens for 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A-catalyzed transpeptidation activity, resulting in 
      enrichment factors of 6,000-fold after a single round of screening. We applied the 
      system to evolve sortase A for improved catalytic activity. After eight rounds of 
      screening, we isolated variants of sortase A with up to a 140-fold increase in 
      LPETG-coupling activity compared with the starting wild-type enzyme. An evolved 
      sortase variant enabled much more efficient labeling of LPETG-tagged human CD154 
      expressed on the surface of HeLa cells compared with wild-type sortase. Because the 
      method developed here does not rely on any particular screenable or selectable 
      property of the substrates or product, it represents a powerful alternative to 
      existing enzyme evolution methods.

AB  - Engineering and bioconjugation of proteins is a critically valuable tool that can 
      facilitate a wide range of biophysical and structural studies. The ability to 
      orthogonally tag or label a domain within a multidomain protein may be complicated 
      by undesirable side reactions to noninvolved domains. Furthermore, the advantages of 
      segmental (or domain-specific) isotopic labeling for NMR, or deuteration for neutron 
      scattering or diffraction, can be realized by an efficient ligation procedure. 
      Common methods-expressed protein ligation, protein trans-splicing, and native 
      chemical ligation-each have specific limitations. Here, we evaluated the use of 
      different variants of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A for a range of ligation 
      reactions and demonstrate that conditions can readily be optimized to yield high 
      efficiency (i.e. completeness of ligation), ease of purification, and functionality 
      in detergents. These properties may enable joining of single domains into 
      multidomain proteins, lipidation to mimic posttranslational modifications, and 
      formation of cyclic proteins to aid in the development of nanodisc membrane 
      mimetics. We anticipate that the method for ligating separate domains into a single 
      functional multidomain protein reported here may enable many applications in 
      structural biology.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is an enzyme obtained from Staphylococcus aureus that catalyzes 
      site-specific transpeptidation of surface proteins to the bacterial cell membrane. 
      SrtA recognizes an LPXTG amino acid motif and cleaves between the Thr and Gly to 
      form a thioester-linked acyl-enzyme intermediate. The intermediate is resolved in 
      the presence of a nucleophilic N-terminal polyglycine resulting in ligation of the 
      acyl donor to the polyglycine acceptor. Here we describe the application of SrtA as 
      a tool for the cyclization of disulfide-rich peptides. Reactions are typically 
      tailored to each disulfide-rich peptide with optimal conditions producing yields of 
      40-50% cyclized peptide.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most notorious pathogens and is frequently 
      associated with nosocomial infections imposing serious risk to immune-compromised 
      patients. This is in part due to its ability to colonize at the surface of 
      indwelling medical devices and biofilm formation. Combating the biofilm formation 
      with antibiotics has its own challenges like higher values of minimum inhibitory 
      concentrations. Here, we describe a new approach to target biofilm formation by Gram 
      positive bacteria. Sortase A is a transpeptidase enzyme which is responsible for 
      tagging of around ∼22 cell surface proteins onto the outer surface. These proteins 
      play a major role in the bacterial virulence. Sortase A recognizes its substrate 
      through LPXTG motif. Here, we use this approach to install the synthetic peptide 
      substrates onS. aureus. Sortase A substrate mimic, 6His-LPETG peptide was 
      synthesized using solid phase peptide chemistry. Incorporation of the peptide on the 
      cell surface was measured using ELISA. Effect of peptide incubation on 
      Staphylococcus aureus biofilm was also studied. 71.1% biofilm inhibition was 
      observed with 100 μM peptide while on silicon coated rubber latex catheter, 45.82% 
      inhibition was observed. The present work demonstrates the inability of surface 
      modified S. aureus to establish biofilm formation thereby presenting a novel method 
      for attenuating its virulence.

TI  - Sortase A-Inhibitory Coumarins from the Folk Medicinal Plant Poncirus trifoliata.
PG  - 3004-3011

AB  - Thirteen coumarins (1-13), including five new compounds (1-5), were isolated from 
      the folk medicinal plant Poncirus trifoliata. Combined spectroscopic analyses 
      revealed that coumarins 1-4 are bis-isoprenylated coumarins with diverse oxidation 
      patterns, while 5 is an enantiomeric di-isoprenylated coumarin. The absolute 
      configurations of the stereogenic centers in the isoprenyl chains were assigned 
      through MTPA and MPA methods, and those of the known compounds triphasiol (6) and 
      ponciol (7) were also assigned using similar methods. These coumarins inhibited 
      significantly Staphylococcus aureus-derived sortase A (SrtA), a transpeptidase 
      responsible for anchoring surface proteins to the peptidoglycan cell wall in 
      Gram-positive bacteria. The present results obtained indicated that the bioactivity 
      and underlying mechanism of action of these coumarins are associated with the 
      inhibition of SrtA-mediated S. aureus adhesion to eukaryotic cell matrix proteins 
      including fibrinogen and fibronectin, thus potentially serving as SrtA inhibitors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Membrane engineering has versatile applications in adoptive cell therapies, 
      immune therapy or drug delivery. Incorporation of lipidated antibody-derived ligands 
      into cells may enforce supraphysiological cell interactions that offer new 
      therapeutic approaches. A challenge is the defined synthesis of lipidated ligands 
      that effectively interact with such membranes. METHODS: Sortase-A was used to attach 
      a PEGylated, dimyristyl lipid-anchor on single-domain antibodies (VHH). The membrane 
      insertion was investigated on liposomal bilayers, myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
      (MDSC) and T cells. RESULTS: The lipidated VHHs remodeled liposomal as well as 
      cellular membranes. The VHH carrying liposomes were successfully targeted towards 
      antigen-positive cells. MDSC and T cells were both modified with lipidated VHHs as 
      detected with an FITC-anti-llama antibody. T cells that carried an anti-CD11b VHH 
      showed cellular association in vitro with CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) MDSC in a two-dimensional 
      magnetic activated cell sorting / flow-cytometry assay. CONCLUSION: The applied 
      combination of chemoenzymatic ligation, PEGylated lipid anchors and single-domain 
      antibodies delivers water-soluble and chemically defined lipidated ligands, which 
      readily associate with liposomal and cellular membranes. This enables liposomal drug 
      targeting and artificial cell-cell interactions. Hence, the presented concept for 
      lipidation of single-domain antibodies is promising for further application in the 
      field of drug delivery or cell-based therapies.

TI  - Sortase A as a tool to functionalize surfaces.
PG  - 828-31
LID - 10.1021/bc4000146 [doi]
AB  - A widely accepted approach to combat surface fouling is based on the prevention of 
      biofoulants to attach to a surface by the functionalization with poly(ethylene 
      glycol) (PEG). The goal of this study was to generate a proof of concept for the 
      enzymatic coupling of PEG to a peptide precoated surface by using the enzyme Sortase 
      A (SrtA). A hydrophobic polystyrene surface was primed with anchoring peptide P3 
      equipped with a pentaglycine acceptor motif for SrtA, to enable subsequent 
      transpeptidation with either biotin or a PEG-tail containing the sortase recognition 
      motif LPETG. High levels of surface-bound biotin were detected only in cases with 
      biotin-LPETG and SrtA. Little if any reactivity was detected in wells treated with 
      the SrtA scrambled motif EGLTP, or in the absence of SrtA. Conjugation of PEG 
      resulted in a significant decrease of bacterial adherence to the surface.

TI  - Identification of Novel Antistaphylococcal Hit Compounds Targeting Sortase A.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26237095 [doi]
LID - 7095
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a causative agent of many hospital- and 
      community-acquired infections with the tendency to develop resistance to all known 
      antibiotics. Therefore, the development of novel antistaphylococcal agents is of 
      urgent need. Sortase A is considered a promising molecular target for the 
      development of antistaphylococcal agents. The main aim of this study was to identify 
      novel sortase A inhibitors. In order to find novel antistaphylococcal agents, we 
      performed phenotypic screening of a library containing 15512 compounds against S. 
      aureus ATCC43300. The molecular docking of hits was performed using the DOCK program 
      and 10 compounds were selected for in vitro enzymatic activity inhibition assay. Two 
      inhibitors were identified, 
      N,N-diethyl-N'-(5-nitro-2-(quinazolin-2-yl)phenyl)propane-1,3-diamine (1) and 
      acridin-9-yl-(1H-benzoimidazol-5-yl)-amine (2), which decrease sortase A activity 
      with IC(50) values of 160.3 µM and 207.01 µM, respectively. It was found that 
      compounds 1 and 2 possess antibacterial activity toward 29 tested multidrug 
      resistant S. aureus strains with MIC values ranging from 78.12 to 312.5 mg/L. These 
      compounds can be used for further structural optimization and biological research.

AB  - The evolution and spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses 
      a significant hidden risk to human public health. The majority of antibiotics used 
      clinically have become mostly ineffective, and so the development of novel 
      anti-infection strategies is urgently required. Since Staphylococcus aureus (S. 
      aureus) cysteine transpeptidase sortase A (SrtA) mediates the surface-anchoring of 
      proteins to its surface, compounds that inhibit SrtA are considered potential 
      antivirulence treatments. Herein, we report on the efficacy of the potent SrtA 
      inhibitor taxifolin (Tax), a flavonoid compound isolated from Chinese herbs. It was 
      able to reversibly block the activity of SrtA with an IC(50) of 24.53 ± 0.42 μM. Tax 
      did not display toxicity toward mammalian cells or S. aureus at a concentration of 
      200 μM. In addition, Tax attenuated the virulence-related phenotype of SrtA in vitro 
      by decreasing the adherence of S. aureus, reducing the formation of a biofilm, and 
      anchoring of S. aureus protein A on its cell wall. The mechanism of the SrtA-Tax 
      interaction was determined using a localized surface plasmon resonance assay. 
      Subsequent mechanistic studies confirmed that Asp-170 and Gln-172 were the principal 
      sites on SrtA with which it binds to Tax. Importantly, in vivo experiments 
      demonstrated that Tax protects mice against pneumonia induced by lethal doses of 
      MRSA, significantly improving their survival rate and reducing the number of viable 
      S. aureus in the lung tissue. The present study indicates that Tax is a useful 
      pioneer compound for the development of novel agents against S. aureus infections.

AB  - Drug-resistant pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) has severely threatened 
      human health and arouses widespread concern. Sortase A (SrtA) is an essential 
      virulence factor of S. aureus, which is responsible for the covalent anchoring of a 
      variety of virulence-related proteins to the cell wall. SrtA has always been 
      regarded as an ideal pharmacological target against S. aureus infections. In this 
      research, we have determined that orientin, a natural compound isolated from various 
      medicinal plants, can effectively inhibit the activity of SrtA with an IC(50) of 
      50.44 ± 0.51 µM. We further demonstrated that orientin inhibited the binding of S. 
      aureus to fibrinogen and diminished biofilm formation and the attaching of 
      Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) to the cell wall in vitro. Using the fluorescence 
      quenching assay, we demonstrated a direct interaction between orientin and SrtA. 
      Further mechanistic studies revealed that the residues Glu-105, Thr-93, and Cys-184 
      were the key sites for the binding of SrtA to orientin. Importantly, we demonstrated 
      that treatment with orientin attenuated S. aureus virulence of in vivo and protected 
      mice against S. aureus-induced lethal pneumonia. These findings indicate that 
      orientin is a potential drug to counter S. aureus infections and limit the 
      development of drug resistance.

AB  - Sortase-mediated ligation (sortagging) is commonly performed using the 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) that strictly recognizes the N-terminal 
      glycine residue. In this work, a rational design of Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A 
      (SpSrtA) for improved transpeptidase activity toward different N-terminal amino acid 
      residues was conducted. The generated variant SpSrtA M3 (E189H/V206I/E215A) showed 
      up to 6.6-fold (vs SpSrtA wild-type) enhanced catalytic efficiency. Additionally, M3 
      retains the specificity toward N-terminal alanine, glycine, serine residues, as well 
      as branched (at α-carbon) primary amines as wild-type parent. Furthermore, M3 was 
      applied for head-to-tail backbone cyclization of proteins.

LID - 6380336
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is an enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of proteins to the cell 
      wall of Gram-positive bacterial membrane, preventing the spread of pathogenic 
      bacterial strains. Here, one class of oxadiazole compounds was distinguished as an 
      efficient inhibitor of SrtA via the "S. aureus Sortase A" substrate-based virtual 
      screening. The current study on 3D-QSAR was done by utilizing preparation of the 
      structure in the Schrödinger software suite and an assessment of 120 derivatives 
      with the crystal structure of 1,2,4-oxadiazole which was extracted from the PDB data 
      bank. The docking operation of the best compound in terms of pMIC (pMIC = 2.77) was 
      done to determine the drug likeliness and binding form of 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
      derivatives as antibiotics in the active site. Using the kNN-MFA way, seven models 
      of 3D-QSAR were created and amongst them, and one model was selected as the best. 
      The chosen model based on q (2) (pred_r (2)) and R (2) values related to the sixth 
      factor of PLS illustrates better and more acceptable external and internal 
      predictions. Values of crossvalidation (pred_r (2)), validation (q (2)), and F were 
      observed 0.5479, 0.6319, and 179.0, respectively, for a test group including 24 
      molecules and the training group including 96 molecules. The external reliability 
      outcomes showed that the acceptable and the selective 3D-QSAR model had a high 
      predictive potential (R (2) = 0.9235) which was confirmed by the Y-randomization 
      test. Besides, the model applicability domain was described successfully to validate 
      the estimation of the model.

TI  - Stability Enhancement of a Dimeric HER2-Specific Affibody Molecule through Sortase 
      A-Catalyzed Head-to-Tail Cyclization.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26102874 [doi]
LID - 2874
AB  - Natural backbone-cyclized proteins have an increased thermostability and resistance 
      towards proteases, characteristics that have sparked interest in head-to-tail 
      cyclization as a method to stability-enhance proteins used in diagnostics and 
      therapeutic applications, for example. In this proof-of principle study, we have 
      produced and investigated a head-to-tail cyclized and HER2-specific Z(HER2:342) 
      Affibody dimer. The sortase A-mediated cyclization reaction is highly efficient 
      (>95%) under optimized conditions, and renders a cyclic Z(HER3:342)-dimer with an 
      apparent melting temperature, T(m), of 68 °C, which is 3 °C higher than that of its 
      linear counterpart. Circular dichroism spectra of the linear and cyclic dimers 
      looked very similar in the far-UV range, both before and after thermal unfolding to 
      90 °C, which suggests that cyclization does not negatively impact the helicity or 
      folding of the cyclic protein. The cyclic dimer had an apparent sub-nanomolar 
      affinity (K(d) ~750 pM) to the HER2-receptor, which is a ~150-fold reduction in 
      affinity relative to the linear dimer (K(d) ~5 pM), but the anti-HER2 Affibody dimer 
      remained a high-affinity binder even after cyclization. No apparent difference in 
      proteolytic stability was detected in an endopeptidase degradation assay for the 
      cyclic and linear dimers. In contrast, in an exopeptidase degradation assay, the 
      linear dimer was shown to be completely degraded after 5 min, while the cyclic dimer 
      showed no detectable degradation even after 60 min. We further demonstrate that a 
      site-specifically DyLight 594-labeled cyclic dimer shows specific binding to 
      HER2-overexpressing cells. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate 
      that head-to-tail cyclization can be an effective strategy to increase the stability 
      of an Affibody dimer.

TI  - Sortase A-Mediated Metabolic Enzyme Ligation in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 1284-1289
AB  - We demonstrate metabolic enzyme ligation using a transpeptidase (Staphylococcal 
      sortase A) in the microbial cytoplasm for the redirection of metabolic flux through 
      metabolic channeling. Here, sortase A expression was controlled by the lac promoter 
      to trigger metabolic channeling by the addition of 
      isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). We tested covalent linking of 
      pyruvate-formate lyase and phosphate acetyltransferase by sortase A-mediated 
      ligation and evaluated the production of acetate. The time point of addition of IPTG 
      was not critical for facilitating metabolic enzyme ligation, and acetate production 
      increased upon expression of sortase A. These results show that sortase A-mediated 
      enzyme ligation enhances an acetate-producing flux in E. coli. We have validated 
      that sortase A-mediated enzyme ligation offers a metabolic channeling approach to 
      redirect a central flux to a desired flux.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) is widely used for site-specific protein 
      modifications, but it lacks the robustness for performing bioconjugation reactions 
      at elevated temperatures or in presence of denaturing agents. Loop engineering and 
      subsequent head-to-tail backbone cyclization of SaSrtA yielded the cyclized variant 
      CyM6 that has a 7.5 °C increased melting temperature and up to 4.6-fold increased 
      resistance towards denaturants when compared to the parent rM4. CyM6 gained up to 
      2.6-fold (vs. parent rM4) yield of conjugate in ligation of peptide and primary 
      amine under denaturing conditions.

TI  - Astilbin Inhibits the Activity of Sortase A from Streptococcus mutans.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24030465 [doi]
LID - 465
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the primary etiological agent of dental caries. 
      The S. mutans enzyme sortase A (SrtA) is responsible for anchoring bacterial cell 
      wall surface proteins involved in host cell attachment and biofilm formation. Thus, 
      SrtA is an attractive target for inhibiting dental caries caused by S. 
      mutans-associated acid fermentation. In this study, we observed that astilbin, a 
      flavanone compound extracted from Rhizoma Smilacis Glabrae, has potent inhibitory 
      activity against the S. mutans SrtA, with an IC(50) of 7.5 μg/mL. In addition, 
      astilbin was proven to reduce the formation of biofilm while without affecting the 
      growth of S. mutans. The results of a molecular dynamics simulation and a mutation 
      analysis revealed that the Arg213, Leu111, and Leu116 of SrtA are important for the 
      interaction between SrtA and astilbin. The results of this study demonstrate the 
      potential of using astilbin as a nonbactericidal agent to modulate pathogenicity of 
      S. mutans by inhibiting the activity of SrtA.

TI  - Targeting Bacterial Sortase A with Covalent Inhibitors: 27 New Starting Points for 
      Structure-Based Hit-to-Lead Optimization.
PG  - 186-194
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00265 [doi]
AB  - Because of its essential role as a bacterial virulence factor, enzyme sortase A 
      (SrtA) has become an attractive target for the development of new antivirulence 
      drugs against Gram-positive infections. Here we describe 27 compounds identified as 
      covalent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus SrtA by screening a library of 
      approximately 50 000 compounds using a FRET assay followed by NMR-based validation 
      and binding reversibility analysis. Nineteen of these compounds displayed only 
      moderate to weak cytotoxicity, with CC(50) against NIH 3T3 mice fibroblast cells 
      ranging from 12 to 740 μM. Analysis using covalent docking suggests that the 
      inhibitors initially associate via hydrophobic interactions, followed by covalent 
      bond formation between the SrtA active site cysteine and an electrophilic center of 
      the inhibitor. The compounds represent good starting points that have the potential 
      to be developed into broad spectrum antivirulence agents as exemplified by 
      hit-to-lead optimization of one of the compounds.

AB  - Sortase A contributes to adhesion and biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans by 
      anchoring surface proteins like P1 onto the cell wall, and few other functional 
      characterization has been annotated to this protein and its coding gene srtA. In 
      this study we investigated that whether srtA deletion would affect S. mutans 
      virulence determinants in addition to adhesion and further explored whether these 
      effects were caused due to changes in S. mutans genomic transcription. We used 
      acid-killing assays, glycolytic rate assessments, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) 
      formation tests to detect whether srtA deletion influenced S. mutans acid 
      tolerance/production and glucan formation. Comparisons between RNA-sequencing data 
      from both the exponential and stationary phases of UA159 and the srtA-deleted strain 
      were made to determine the impact of srtA knockout on S. mutans genomic 
      transcription. Results of our assays indicated that S. mutans aciduricity was 
      enhanced in the srtA deleted strain when bacterial cells were directly subjected to 
      pH 2.8, but the enhancement was repressed when the acid tolerance response was 
      induced in advance. The srtA mutation strain exhibited reduced EPS formation in 
      mature biofilms. SrtA deletion led to pleiotropic changes in the S. mutans 
      transcriptome with a growth phase-dependent pattern. The affected genes mainly 
      included those involved in aciduricity, carbohydrate transport, and EPS formation. 
      It was concluded that S. mutans srtA exhibited multiple effects on the virulence 
      traits of this pathogen, including acid tolerance and glucan formation, and that 
      these alterations could be partially due to transcriptional changes upon loss of 
      srtA.

AB  - Metabolic engineering has been an important approach for microbial bio-production. 
      To produce bio-chemicals with engineered microorganisms, metabolic pathways have 
      been edited using several common strategies, including gene disruption, gene 
      overexpression, and gene attenuation. Here, we demonstrated metabolic channeling 
      based on enzymatic metabolic enzyme ligation as a noteworthy approach for enhancing 
      a desired metabolic flux. To achieve metabolic channeling , the metabolic enzymes 
      should be in close proximity in cells. In the literature, several methodologies have 
      been recently applied to achieve metabolic channeling . Meanwhile, we have proposed 
      a strategy for possessing metabolic enzymes in close proximity, by utilizing sortase 
      A as a stapler to tether such enzymes in Escherichia coli. By tethering metabolic 
      enzymes that catalyze the reactions before and after a target metabolite, the 
      metabolic flux may be enhanced. This chapter describes the approach for enhancing 
      acetate-producing flux by sortase-A-assisted metabolic ligation in E. coli.

AB  - Protein antigens are, in general, weakly immunogenic, and therefore require 
      co-delivery with adjuvants to stimulate potent immune responses. The fusion of 
      (poly)peptide antigens to immunostimulatory adjuvants (e.g. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
      agonists) has been demonstrated to greatly improve vaccine potency compared to 
      mixtures of antigen and adjuvant. Chemical approaches, to enable the rapid, 
      site-specific and high-yielding linkage of TLR2 ligands to recombinant protein 
      antigens, have been previously optimized. These approaches require the use of 
      denaturing conditions to ensure high reaction yields, which limits their 
      application, as maintenance of native protein folding is necessary to elicit 
      antibodies against conformational epitopes. Here, this work aimed to optimize an 
      alternative method, to ensure the efficient bioconjugation of TLR2 ligands onto 
      folded protein antigens. An enzyme-mediated approach, using Staphylococcus aureus 
      sortase A (or a penta mutant with enhanced efficiency), was optimized for reaction 
      yield and time, as well as enzyme type and amount. This approach enabled the 
      site-specific conjugation of the TLR2-agonist fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 
      (FSL-1) onto a model group A Streptococcus (GAS) recombinant polytope antigen under 
      conditions that maintain protein folding, yielding a homogeneous, 
      molecularly-defined product, with ligation yields as high as 90%. Following 
      intramuscular (IM) administration of the ligation product to humanized plasminogen 
      AlbPLG1 mice, high-titer, antigen-specific IgG antibodies were observed, which 
      conferred protection against subcutaneous challenge with GAS strain 5448. In 
      comparison, mixtures of the GAS antigen with aluminum hydroxide or FSL-1 failed to 
      provide protection, with the FSL-1 mixture yielding ~1000-fold lower 
      antigen-specific IgG antibody titers, and the mixture with alum yielding a 
      Th2-biased response compared to the more balanced Th1/Th2 responses observed with 
      the FSL-1 conjugate. Overall, a FSL-1 bioconjugation method for the efficient 
      production of antigen-TLR2 agonist conjugates, which maintain protein folding, was 
      produced, with broad utility for the development of self-adjuvanting vaccines 
      against subunit protein antigens.

TI  - Prospecting Potential Inhibitors of Sortase A from Enterococcus faecalis: A 
      Multidrug Resistant Bacteria, through In-silico and In-vitro Approaches.
PG  - 582-592
LID - 10.2174/0929866527666191227143048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) infections are becoming dreadfully common in 
      hospital environments. Infections caused by Ef are difficult to treat because of its 
      acquired resistance to different class of antibiotics, making it a multidrug 
      resistant bacteria. Key pathogenic factor of Ef includes its ability to form biofilm 
      on the surface of diagnostic and other medical devices. Sortase A (SrtA) is a 
      cysteine transpeptidase which plays a pivotal role in the formation of biofilm in 
      Ef, hence, it is considered as an important enzyme for the pathogenesis of Ef. Thus, 
      inhibition of (SrtA) will affect biofilm formation, which will reduce its virulence 
      and eventually Ef infection will be abridged. OBJECTIVE: To find potential 
      inhibitors of Enterococcus faecalis Sortase A (EfSrtA) through insilico and in-vitro 
      methods. METHODS: Gene coding for EfSrtA was cloned, expressed and purified. 
      Three-dimensional model of EfSrtA was created using Swiss-Model workspace. In-silico 
      docking studies using Autodock vina and molecular dynamics simulations of the 
      modelled structures using Gromacs platform were performed to explore potential lead 
      compounds against EfSrtA. In-vitro binding experiments using spectrofluorometric 
      technique was carried out to confirm and validate the study. RESULTS: In-silico 
      docking and in-vitro binding experiments revealed that curcumin, berberine and 
      myricetin bound to EfSrtA at nanomolar concentrations with high affinity. 
      CONCLUSION: This is a first structural report of EfSrtA with curcumin, berberine and 
      myricetin. Taking in account the herbal nature of these compounds, the use of these 
      compounds as inhibitors will be advantageous. This study validated curcumin, 
      berberine and myricetin as potential inhibitors of EfSrtA.

AB  - Sortase A is a thiol transpeptidase expressed by Gram-positive bacteria. This enzyme 
      is capable of site-specifically ligating peptides containing the C-terminal 
      recognition motif LPXTG to peptides containing an N-terminal polyglycine sequence, 
      forming a native peptide bond. Here, we describe the preparation and application of 
      sortase A to the ligation of two individually folded disulfide-rich animal venom 
      peptides in order to form a heterodimeric double-knotted peptide with a native 
      peptide linker. This method is mild enough to preserve the structures and disulfide 
      connectivities of the peptides during ligation. We employed a highly efficient 
      sortase A pentamutant (SrtA5°), which brings the reaction to completion within 
      15 min with a ~50-80% yield of ligated peptide.

TI  - Sequence variation in the β7-β8 loop of bacterial class A sortase enzymes alters 
      substrate selectivity.

AB  - Gram-positive bacteria contain sortase enzymes on their cell surfaces that catalyze 
      transpeptidation reactions critical for proper cellular function. In vitro, sortases 
      are used in sortase-mediated ligation (SML) reactions for a variety of protein 
      engineering applications. Historically, sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus 
      (saSrtA) has been the enzyme of choice to catalyze SML reactions. However, the 
      stringent specificity of saSrtA for the LPXTG sequence motif limits its uses. Here, 
      we describe the impact on substrate selectivity of a structurally conserved loop 
      with a high degree of sequence variability in all classes of sortases. We 
      investigate the contribution of this β7-β8 loop by designing and testing chimeric 
      sortase enzymes. Our chimeras utilize natural sequence variation of class A sortases 
      from eight species engineered into the SrtA sequence from Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
      While some of these chimeric enzymes mimic the activity and selectivity of the WT 
      protein from which the loop sequence was derived (e.g., that of saSrtA), others 
      results in chimeric Streptococcus pneumoniae SrtA enzymes that are able to 
      accommodate a range of residues in the final position of the substrate motif 
      (LPXTX). Using mutagenesis, structural comparisons, and sequence analyses, we 
      identify three interactions facilitated by β7-β8 loop residues that appear to be 
      broadly conserved or converged upon in class A sortase enzymes. These studies 
      provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of sortase target selectivity and 
      can expand the sortase toolbox for future SML applications.

AB  - Sortases are a group of enzymes displayed on the cell-wall of Gram-positive 
      bacteria. They are responsible for the attachment of virulence factors onto the 
      peptidoglycan in a transpeptidation reaction through recognition of a pentapeptide 
      substrate. Most housekeeping sortases recognize one specific pentapeptide motif; 
      however, Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A (SpSrtA WT) recognizes LPETG, LPETA and 
      LPKLG motifs. Here, we examined SpSrtA's flexible substrate specificity by 
      investigating the role of the β7/β8 loop in determining substrate specificity. We 
      exchanged the β7/β8 loop in SpSrtA with corresponding β7/β8 loops from 
      Staphylococcus aureus (SaSrtA WT) and Bacillus anthracis (BaSrtA WT). While the 
      BaSrtA-derived variant showed no enzymatic activity toward either LPETG or LPETA 
      substrates, the activity of the SaSrtA-derived mutant toward the LPETA substrate was 
      completely abolished. Instead, the mutant had an improved activity toward LPETG, the 
      preferred substrate of SaSrtA WT.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) causes a broad variety of diseases. The spread of 
      multidrugresistant S. aureus highlights the need to develop new ways to combat S. 
      aureus infections. Sortase A (SrtA) can anchor proteins containing LPXTG binding 
      motifs to the bacteria surface and plays a key role in S. aureus infections, making 
      it a promising antivirulence target. In the present study, we used aSrtA activity 
      inhibition assay to discover that isovitexin, a Chinese herbal product, can inhibit 
      SrtA activity with an IC(50) of 28.98 μg/ml. Using a fibrinogenbinding assay and a 
      biofilm formation assay, we indirectly proved the SrtA inhibitory activity of 
      isovitexin. Additionally, isovitexin treatment decreased the amount of 
      staphylococcal protein A (SpA) on the surface of the cells. These data suggest that 
      isovitexin has the potential to be an anti-infective drug against S. aureus via the 
      inhibition of sortase activity.

AB  - Multivalent proteins or protein dendrimers are useful for clinical and 
      biotechnological applications. However, assembly of chemically defined protein 
      dendrimers is a challenging endeavor. In the past, majority of protein dendrimers 
      have been developed on branched lysine scaffolds and are usually limited to a 
      valency of two to four. The naturally occurring cyclodextrin (CD) scaffold composed 
      of 6-8 glucose units offers the possibility of expanding the valency. Here we have 
      adapted a chemoenzymatic-click strategy for displaying heptavalent peptides and 
      large proteins on the β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) scaffold. We demonstrate that 
      recombinant proteins (engineered with a LPXTG pentapeptide motif at the carboxy 
      terminus), labeled with an alkyne moiety by sortase-mediated ligation, can be easily 
      clicked on to the azide-derivatized β-cyclodextrin through the Huisgen cycloaddition 
      reaction yielding a well-defined heptavalent display of proteins.

AB  - Phage display of combinatorial antibody libraries is a versatile tool in the field 
      of antibody engineering, with diverse applications including monoclonal antibody 
      (mAb) discovery, affinity maturation, and humanization. To improve the selection 
      efficiency of antibody libraries, we developed a new phagemid display system that 
      addresses the complication of bald phage propagation. The phagemid facilitates the 
      biotinylation of fragment of antigen binding (Fab) antibody fragments displayed on 
      phage via Sortase A catalysis and the subsequent enrichment of Fab-displaying phage 
      during selections. In multiple contexts, this selection approach improved the 
      enrichment of target-reactive mAbs by depleting background phage. Panels of cancer 
      cell line-reactive mAbs with high diversity and specificity were isolated from a 
      naïve chimeric rabbit/human Fab library using this approach, highlighting its 
      potential to accelerate antibody engineering efforts and to empower concerted 
      antibody drug and target discovery.

TI  - Sortase A as a tool for high-yield histatin cyclization.
PG  - 2650-8
LID - 10.1096/fj.11-182212 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic peptides are highly valued tools in biomedical research. In many cases, they 
      show higher receptor affinity, enhanced biological activity, and improved serum 
      stability. Technical difficulties in producing cyclic peptides, especially larger 
      ones, in appreciable yields have precluded a prolific use in biomedical research. 
      Here, we describe a novel and efficient cyclization method that uses the 
      peptidyl-transferase activity of the Staphylococcus aureus enzyme sortase A to 
      cyclize linear synthetic precursor peptides. As a model, we used histatin 1, a 
      38-mer salivary peptide with motogenic activity. Chemical cyclization of histatin 1 
      resulted in ≤ 3% yields, whereas sortase-mediated cyclization provided a yield of 
      >90%. The sortase-cyclized peptide displayed a maximum wound closure activity at 10 
      nM, whereas the linear peptide displayed maximal activity at 10 μM. Circular 
      dichroism and NMR spectroscopic analysis of the linear and cyclic peptide in 
      solution showed no evidence for conformational changes, suggesting that structural 
      differences due to cyclization only became manifest when these peptides were located 
      in the binding domain of the receptor. The sortase-based cyclization technology 
      provides a general method for easy and efficient manufacturing of large cyclic 
      peptides.

AB  - Sortase-mediated ligation is one of the most commonly used chemo-enzymatic 
      techniques for the site-specific modification of proteins. We have established a new 
      library of sortase mutants for directed evolution of sortase substrate selectivity. 
      Phage display screens of this second-generation library yielded sortase mutants that 
      ligate substrate proteins containing an APxTG or FPxTG recognition sequence instead 
      of the canonical LPxTG sorting motif. These findings indicate that the 
      second-generation sortase library is well suited for sortase engineering in order to 
      increase the versatility of sortase-mediated ligation. Copyright © 2017 European

TI  - Chinese herb medicine against Sortase A catalyzed transformations, a key role in 
      gram-positive bacterial infection progress.
PG  - 184-196
AB  - Many Gram-positive bacteria can anchor their surface proteins to the cell wall 
      peptidoglycan covalently by a common mechanism with Sortase A (SrtA), thus escaping 
      from the host's identification of immune cells. SrtA can complete this anchoring 
      process by cleaving LPXTG motif conserved among these surface proteins and thus 
      these proteins anchor on the cell wall. Moreover, those SrtA mutants lose this 
      capability to anchor these relative proteins, with these bacteria no longer 
      infectious. Therefore, SrtA inhibitors can be promising anti-infective agents to 
      cure bacterial infections. Chinese herb medicines (CHMs) (chosen from Science 
      Citation Index) have exhibited inhibition on SrtA of Gram-positive pathogens 
      irreversibly or reversibly. In general, CHMs are likely to have important long-term 
      impact as new antibacterial compounds and sought after by academia and the 
      pharmaceutical industry. This review mainly focuses on SrtA inhibitors from CHMs and 
      the potential inhibiting mechanism related to chemical structures of compounds in 
      CHMs.

TI  - Long-Acting Human Interleukin 2 Bioconjugate Modified with Fatty Acids by Sortase A.
PG  - 615-625
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00062 [doi]
AB  - Human Interleukin 2 (IL-2) has already achieved impressive results as a therapeutic 
      agent for cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, one of the limitations associated 
      with the clinical application of IL-2 is its short half-life owing to rapid 
      clearance by the kidneys. Modification with fatty acids, as an albumin noncovalent 
      ligand with the advantage of deep penetration into tissues and high activity-to-mass 
      ratio, is a commonly used approach to improve the half-life of native peptides and 
      proteins. In this investigation, we attempted to extend the half-life of IL-2 
      through conjugation with a fatty acid using sortase A (srtA). We initially designed 
      and optimized three IL-2 analogues with different peptide linkers between the 
      C-terminus of IL-2 and srtA recognition sequence (LPETG). Among these, analogue A3 
      was validated as the optimal IL-2 analogue for further modification. Next, six fatty 
      acid moieties with the same fatty acid and different hydrophilic spacers were 
      conjugated to A3 through srtA. The six bioconjugates generated were screened for in 
      vitro biological activity, among which bioconjugate B6 was identified as 
      near-optimal to IL-2. Additionally, B6 could effectively bind albumin through the 
      conjugated fatty acid, which contributed to a significant improvement in its 
      pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. In summary, we have developed a novel IL-2 
      bioconjugate, B6, modified with fatty acids using srtA, which may effectively serve 
      as a new-generation long-acting IL-2 immunotherapeutic agent.

TI  - Characterisation of the Brochothrix thermosphacta sortase A enzyme.
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fny184 [doi]
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria utilise class A sortases to coat the surface of their cells 
      with a diversity of proteins that facilitate interactions with their environment and 
      play fundamental roles in cell physiology and virulence. A putative sortase A gene 
      was identified in the genome of the poorly studied meat spoilage bacterium 
      Brochothrix thermosphacta. To understand how this bacterium mediates interactions 
      with its environment, an N-terminal truncated, His-tagged variant of this protein 
      (His6-BtSrtA) was expressed and purified. Catalytic activity of recombinant 
      His6-BtSrtA was investigated, including sorting motif recognition of target proteins 
      and bioconjugation activity. Further, the B. thermosphacta genome was examined for 
      the presence of sortase A (SrtA) protein substrates. His6-BtSrtA readily formed 
      intermediate complexes with LPXTG-tagged proteins. Although the reaction was 
      inefficient, nucleophilic attack of the resultant thioacyl intermediates by 
      tri-glycine was observed. Genome examination identified 11 potential SrtA 
      substrates, two of which contained protein domains associated with adherence of 
      pathogens to host extracellular matrix proteins and cells, suggesting the B. 
      thermosphacta SrtA may be indirectly involved in its attachment to meat surfaces. 
      Thus, further work in this area could provide crucial insight into molecular 
      mechanisms involved in the colonisation of meat by B. thermosphacta.

TI  - Facile Generation of Potent Bispecific Fab via Sortase A and Click Chemistry for 
      Cancer Immunotherapy.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13184540 [doi]
LID - 4540
AB  - Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) for T cell engagement have shown great promise in 
      cancer immunotherapy, and their clinical applications have been proven in treating 
      hematological malignance. Bispecific antibody binding fragment (BiFab) represents a 
      promising platform for generating non-Fc bispecific antibodies. However, the 
      generation of BiFab is still challenging, especially by means of chemical 
      conjugation. More conjugation strategies, e.g., enzymatic conjugation and modular 
      BiFab preparation, are needed to improve the robustness and flexibility of BiFab 
      preparation. We successfully used chemo-enzymatic conjugation approach to generate 
      bispecific antibody (i.e., BiFab) with Fabs from full-length antibodies. Paired 
      click handles (e.g., N(3) and DBCO) was introduced to the C-terminal LPETG tag of 
      Fabs via sortase A mediated transpeptidation, followed by site-specific conjugation 
      between two click handle-modified Fabs for BiFab generation. Both BiFab(CD20/CD3) 
      (EC(50) = 0.26 ng/mL) and BiFab(Her2/CD3) exhibited superior efficacy in mediating T 
      cells, from either PBMC or ATC, to kill target tumor cell lines while spared 
      antigen-negative tumor cells in vitro. The BiFab(CD20/CD3) also efficiently 
      inhibited CD20-positive tumor growth in mouse xenograft model. We have established a 
      facile sortase A-mediated click handle installation to generate homogeneous and 
      functional BiFabs. The exemplary BiFabs against different targets showed superior 
      efficacy in redirecting and activating T cells to specifically kill target tumor 
      cells, demonstrating the robustness of sortase A-mediated "bio-click" chemistry in 
      generating various potent BiFabs. This approach also holds promise for further 
      efficient construction of a Fab derivative library for personalized tumor 
      immunotherapy in the future.

TI  - Asymmetric Disulfanylbenzamides as Irreversible and Selective Inhibitors of 
      Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A.
PG  - 839-850
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.201900687 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most frequent causes of nosocomial and 
      community-acquired infections, with drug-resistant strains being responsible for 
      tens of thousands of deaths per year. S. aureus sortase A inhibitors are designed to 
      interfere with virulence determinants. We have identified disulfanylbenzamides as a 
      new class of potent inhibitors against sortase A that act by covalent modification 
      of the active-site cysteine. A broad series of derivatives were synthesized to 
      derive structure-activity relationships (SAR). In vitro and in silico methods 
      allowed the experimentally observed binding affinities and selectivities to be 
      rationalized. The most active compounds were found to have single-digit micromolar 
      K(i) values and caused up to a 66 % reduction of S. aureus fibrinogen attachment at 
      an effective inhibitor concentration of 10 μM. This new molecule class exhibited 
      minimal cytotoxicity, low bacterial growth inhibition and impaired sortase-mediated 
      adherence of S. aureus cells.

      biocatalysts with improved thermostability and catalytic efficiency.

AB  - (S)-carbonyl reductase II (SCRII) from Candida parapsilosis is a short-chain alcohol 
      dehydrogenase/reductase. It catalyses the conversion of 2-hydroxyacetophenone to 
      (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol with low efficiency. Sortase was reported as a molecular 
      "stapler" for site-specific protein conjugation to strengthen or add protein 
      functionality. Here, we describe Staphylococcus aureus sortase A-mediated 
      crosslinking of SCRII to produce stable catalysts for efficient biotransformation. 
      Via a native N-terminal glycine and an added GGGGSLPETGG peptide at C-terminus of 
      SCRII, SCRII subunits were conjugated by sortase A to form crosslinked SCRII, mainly 
      dimers and trimers. The crosslinked SCRII showed over 6-fold and 4-fold increases, 
      respectively, in activity and k (cat)/K (m) values toward 2-hydroxyacetophenone 
      compared with wild-type SCRII. Moreover, crosslinked SCRII was much more 
      thermostable with its denaturation temperature (T(m)) increased to 60 °C. 
      Biotransformation result showed that crosslinked SCRII gave a product optical purity 
      of 100% and a yield of >99.9% within 3 h, a 16-fold decrease in transformation 
      duration with respect to Escherichia coli/pET-SCRII. Sortase A-catalysed ligation 
      also obviously improved T(m)s and product yields of eight other short-chain alcohol 
      dehydrogenases/reductases. This work demonstrates a generic technology to improve 
      enzyme function and thermostability through sortase A-mediated crosslinking of 
      oxidoreductases.

AB  - The inhibition or prevention of biofilm formation represents an emerging strategy in 
      the war against antibiotic resistance, interfering with key players in bacterial 
      virulence. This approach includes the inhibition of the catalytic activity of 
      transpeptidase sortase A (Srt A), a membrane enzyme responsible for covalently 
      attaching a wide variety of adhesive matrix molecules to the peptidoglycan cell wall 
      in Gram-positive strains. A new series of seventeen 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives was 
      efficiently synthesized and screened as potential new anti-virulence agents. The 
      ability of inhibiting biofilm formation was evaluated against both Gram-positive and 
      Gram-negative pathogens. Remarkably, all these compounds inhibited S. aureus and/or 
      P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in a dose dependent manner, with 50% biofilm 
      inhibitory concentrations (BIC(50s)) below 10 μM for the most active compounds. 
      Inhibition of SrtA was validated as one of the possible mechanisms of action of 
      these new 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives, in the tested Gram-positive pathogen, using 
      a specific enzymatic assay for a recombinant S. aureus SrtA. The three most active 
      compounds, eliciting BIC(50) values for S. aureus ATCC 25923 between 0.7 and 9.7 μM, 
      showed a good activity toward the enzyme eliciting IC(50) values ranging from 2.2 to 
      10.4 μM.

AB  - Aim: Confirmation of the enzymatic activity of Class A sortase (SrtA) in probiotic 
      strain Lactobacillus acidophilus associated with the adhesion properties. Materials 
      & methods: SrtA from L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 was purified and its enzymatic 
      properties was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis approach and the 
      sensitivity to metal ions was also detected. Results: SrtA of L. acidophilus 
      ATCC4356 can recognize LPxTG and LPxTD sorting motifs. The active sites of SrtA 
      include His137, Cys198 and Arg205. Furthermore, acacetin can increase the activity 
      of SrtA, while phenyl vinyl sulfone could effectively inhibit the activity of SrtA 
      with an IC(50) of 143.32 μg/ml. The adhesion ability of L. acidophilus was also 
      decreased resulting from the inhibition of SrtA activity. Conclusion: The unique 
      properties of SrtA of L. acidophilus can provide some insights into the development 
      of high-adhesion Lactobacillus strains in the GI tract.

AB  - As a natural inhibitor of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-кB ligand 
      (RANKL), osteprotegerin (OPG) is considered a promising treatment for metabolic bone 
      diseases. Typical approaches for preparing recombinant OPG or its derivatives employ 
      eukaryotic expression systems. Due to the advantages of a prokaryotic expression 
      system, which include its convenience, low cost, and abundant production, in this 
      study, we establish a strategy for preparing functional OPG using the Escherichia 
      coli expression system. After initial failures in preparation of OPG and its 
      truncation, OPG cysteine-rich domain (OPG-CRD/OPGT) by using pET and pGEX vectors, 
      we constructed a sortase A (SrtA)-aided E. coli expression system, in which the 
      expressed protein was a self-cleaving SrtA fusion protein. Using this system, we 
      successfully prepared the recombinant OPGT protein. The BIAcore analyses indicated 
      that the prepared OPGT had high affinities in binding with RANKL and TRAIL. Cell 
      experiments confirmed the inhibitory effects of the prepared OPGT on RANKL-induced 
      osteoclast differentiation and TRAIL-induced tumor cell apoptosis. The sortase 
      A-aided E. coli expression system for OPGT established in this study may contribute 
      to further studies and commercial applications of OPG.

AB  - Here, we describe the most promising small synthetic organic compounds that act as 
      potent Sortase A inhibitors and cater the potential to be developed as antivirulence 
      drugs. Sortase A is a polypeptide of 206 amino acids, which catalyzes two sequential 
      reactions: (i) thioesterification and (ii) transpeptidation. Sortase A is involved 
      in the process of bacterial adhesion by anchoring LPXTG-containing proteins to lipid 
      II. Sortase A inhibitors do not affect bacterial growth, but they restrain the 
      virulence of pathogenic bacterial strains, thereby preventing infections caused by 
      Staphylococcus aureus or other Gram-positive bacteria. The efficacy of the most 
      promising inhibitors needs to be comprehensively evaluated in in vivo models of 
      infection, in order to select compounds eligible for the treatment of bacterial 
      infections in humans.

AB  - Protein bioconjugation has been a crucial tool for studying biological processes and 
      developing therapeutics. Sortase A (SrtA), a bacterial transpeptidase, has become 
      widely used for its ability to site-specifically label proteins with diverse 
      functional moieties, but a significant limitation is its poor reaction kinetics. In 
      this work, we address this by developing proximity-based sortase-mediated ligation 
      (PBSL), which improves the ligation efficiency to over 95 % by linking the target 
      protein to SrtA using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher peptide-protein pair. By expressing the 
      target protein with SpyTag C-terminal to the SrtA recognition motif, it can be 
      covalently captured by an immobilized SpyCatcher-SrtA fusion protein during 
      purification. Following the ligation reaction, SpyTag is cleaved off, rendering PBSL 
      traceless, and only the labeled protein is released, simplifying target protein 
      purification and labeling to a single step.

TI  - Monitoring T cell-dendritic cell interactions in vivo by intercellular enzymatic 
      labelling.
PG  - 496-500
LID - 10.1038/nature25442 [doi]
AB  - Interactions between different cell types are essential for multiple biological 
      processes, including immunity, embryonic development and neuronal signalling. 
      Although the dynamics of cell-cell interactions can be monitored in vivo by 
      intravital microscopy, this approach does not provide any information on the 
      receptors and ligands involved or enable the isolation of interacting cells for 
      downstream analysis. Here we describe a complementary approach that uses bacterial 
      sortase A-mediated cell labelling across synapses of immune cells to identify 
      receptor-ligand interactions between cells in living mice, by generating a signal 
      that can subsequently be detected ex vivo by flow cytometry. We call this approach 
      for the labelling of 'kiss-and-run' interactions between immune cells 'Labelling 
      Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts' (LIPSTIC). Using LIPSTIC, 
      we show that interactions between dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells during T-cell 
      priming in vivo occur in two distinct modalities: an early, cognate stage, during 
      which CD40-CD40L interactions occur specifically between T cells and antigen-loaded 
      dendritic cells; and a later, non-cognate stage during which these interactions no 
      longer require prior engagement of the T-cell receptor. Therefore, LIPSTIC enables 
      the direct measurement of dynamic cell-cell interactions both in vitro and in vivo. 
      Given its flexibility for use with different receptor-ligand pairs and a range of 
      detectable labels, we expect that this approach will be of use to any field of 
      biology requiring quantification of intercellular communication.

TI  - Effects of ketamine in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and in silico 
      interaction with sortase A.
PG  - 885-893
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2021-0093 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the main human 
      pathogens and is responsible for many diseases, ranging from skin infections to more 
      invasive infections. These infections are dangerous and expensive to treat because 
      these strains are resistant to a large number of conventional antibiotics. Thus, the 
      antibacterial effect of ketamine against MRSA strains, its mechanism of action, and 
      in silico interaction with sortase A were evaluated. The antibacterial effect of 
      ketamine was assessed using the broth microdilution method. Subsequently, the 
      mechanism of action was assessed using flow cytometry and molecular docking assays 
      with sortase A. Our results showed that ketamine has a significant antibacterial 
      activity against MRSA strains in the range of 2.49-3.73 mM. Their mechanism of 
      action involves alterations in membrane integrity and DNA damage, reducing cell 
      viability, and inducing apoptosis. In addition, ketamine had an affinity for S. 
      aureus sortase A. These results indicate that this compound can be used as an 
      alternative to develop new strategies to combat infections caused by MRSA.

AB  - The critical role of sortase A in gram-positive bacterial pathogenicity makes this 
      protein a good potential target for antimicrobial therapy. In this study, we report 
      for the first time the crystal structure of Listeria monocytogenes sortase A and 
      identify the active sites that mediate its transpeptidase activity. We also used a 
      sortase A (SrtA) enzyme activity inhibition assay, simulation, and isothermal 
      titration calorimetry analysis to discover that chalcone, an agent with little 
      anti-L. monocytogenes activity, could significantly inhibit sortase A activity with 
      an IC50 of 28.41 ± 5.34 μM by occupying the active site of SrtA. The addition of 
      chalcone to a co-culture of L. monocytogenes and Caco-2 cells significantly 
      inhibited bacterial entry into the cells and L. monocytogenes-mediated cytotoxicity. 
      Additionally, chalcone treatment decreased the mortality of infected mice, the 
      bacterial burden in target organs, and the pathological damage to L. 
      monocytogenes-infected mice. In conclusion, these findings suggest that chalcone is 
      a promising candidate for the development of treatment against L. monocytogenes 
      infection.

TI  - The M Protein of Streptococcus pyogenes Strain AP53 Retains Cell Surface Functional 
      Plasminogen Binding after Inactivation of the Sortase A Gene.
LID - 10.1128/JB.00096-20 [doi]
LID - e00096-20
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A Streptococcus [GAS]) is a β-hemolytic 
      human-selective pathogen that is responsible for a large number of morbid and mortal 
      infections in humans. For efficient infection, GAS requires different types of 
      surface proteins that provide various mechanisms for evading human innate immune 
      responses, thus enhancing pathogenicity of the bacteria. Many such 
      virulence-promoting proteins, including the major surface signature M protein, are 
      translocated after biosynthesis through the cytoplasmic membrane and temporarily 
      tethered to this membrane via a type 1 transmembrane domain (TMD) positioned near 
      the COOH terminus. In these proteins, a sorting signal, LPXTG, is positioned 
      immediately upstream of the TMD, which is cleaved by the membrane-associated 
      transpeptidase, sortase A (SrtA), leading to the covalent anchoring of these 
      proteins to newly emerging l-Ala-l-Ala cross-bridges of the growing peptidoglycan 
      cell wall. Herein, we show that inactivation of the srtA gene in a skin-tropic 
      pattern D GAS strain (AP53) results in retention of the M protein in the cell 
      membrane. However, while the isogenic AP53 ΔsrtA strain is attenuated in overall 
      pathogenic properties due to effects on the integrity of the cell membrane, our data 
      show that the M protein nonetheless can extend from the cytoplasmic membrane through 
      the cell wall and then to the surface of the bacteria and thereby retain its 
      important properties of productively binding and activating fluid-phase host 
      plasminogen (hPg). The studies presented herein demonstrate an underappreciated 
      additional mechanism of cell surface display of bacterial virulence proteins via 
      their retention in the cell membrane and extension to the GAS surface.IMPORTANCE 
      Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is a human-specific pathogen that produces many 
      surface factors, including its signature M protein, that contribute to its 
      pathogenicity. M proteins undergo specific membrane localization and anchoring to 
      the cell wall via the transpeptidase sortase A. Herein, we explored the role of 
      sortase A function on M protein localization, architecture, and function, employing, 
      a skin-tropic GAS isolate, AP53, which expresses a human plasminogen (hPg)-binding M 
      (PAM) Protein. We showed that PAM anchored in the cell membrane, due to the targeted 
      inactivation of sortase A, was nonetheless exposed on the cell surface and 
      functionally interacted with host hPg. We demonstrate that M proteins, and possibly 
      other sortase A-processed proteins that are retained in the cell membrane, can still 
      function to initiate pathogenic processes by this underappreciated mechanism.

AB  - We have developed a new ligation independent cloning (LIC) vector - pSrtA9, which 
      can be utilized for one-step purification of recombinant proteins. The new LIC site 
      in the pSrtA9 vector, hosts a DNA sequence centered on a SfoI restriction site and 
      integrates a coding sequence for sortase A (SrtA) recognition. Preceding the LIC 
      site, pSrtA9 incorporates an N-terminal 6xHis-tag and the catalytic core of SrtA 
      from Staphylococcus aureus (SrtAΔ59). Thus, after cloning and protein expression in 
      Escherichia coli, the resultant fusion protein comprises an N-terminal 6xHis-tag, 
      SrtAΔ59, an L-P-E-T-G linker and the protein of interest at the C-terminus. The 
      fusion protein can be captured onto immobilized Ni-NTA resin and any unwanted 
      proteolysis activity of SrtA is suppressed during the purification by optimisation 
      of solution conditions. Upon addition of Ca(2+) and triglycine (Gly(3)), the 
      immobilized fusion protein undergoes on-column SrtA-mediated cleavage at the T-G 
      bond of LPETG linker to selectively release 90% of the protein of interest within 
      3 h when incubated at room temperature. This new pSrtA9 vector, thus, offers an 
      efficient method for LIC of genes and a one-step purification procedure to obtain a 
      tag-free recombinant protein, and is therefore suitable for the high-throughput 
      proteins production.

TI  - Sorting out the Superbugs: Potential of Sortase A Inhibitors among Other 
      Antimicrobial Strategies to Tackle the Problem of Antibiotic Resistance.
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics10020164 [doi]
LID - 164
AB  - Rapid spread of antibiotic resistance throughout the kingdom bacteria is inevitably 
      bringing humanity towards the "post-antibiotic" era. The emergence of so-called 
      "superbugs"-pathogen strains that develop resistance to multiple conventional 
      antibiotics-is urging researchers around the globe to work on the development or 
      perfecting of alternative means of tackling the pathogenic bacteria infections. 
      Although various conceptually different approaches are being considered, each comes 
      with its advantages and drawbacks. While drug-resistant pathogens are undoubtedly 
      represented by both Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria, possible target spectrum across 
      the proposed alternative approaches of tackling them is variable. Numerous 
      anti-virulence strategies aimed at reducing the pathogenicity of target bacteria 
      rather than eliminating them are being considered among such alternative approaches. 
      Sortase A (SrtA) is a membrane-associated cysteine protease that catalyzes a cell 
      wall sorting reaction by which surface proteins, including virulence factors, are 
      anchored to the bacterial cell wall of Gram(+) bacteria. Although SrtA inhibition 
      seems perspective among the Gram-positive pathogen-targeted antivirulence 
      strategies, it still remains less popular than other alternatives. A decrease in 
      virulence due to inactivation of SrtA activity has been extensively studied in 
      Staphylococcus aureus, but it has also been demonstrated in other Gram(+) species. 
      In this manuscript, results of past studies on the discovery of novel SrtA 
      inhibitory compounds and evaluation of their potency were summarized and commented 
      on. Here, we discussed the rationale behind the inhibition of SrtA, raised some 
      concerns on the comparability of the results from different studies, and touched 
      upon the possible resistance mechanisms as a response to implementation of such 
      therapy in practice. The goal of this article is to encourage further studies of 
      SrtA inhibitory compounds.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tooth decay is a common chronic disease that causes pain, 
      tooth loss, malnutrition, anxiety and significantly affects half of the world's 
      population. Streptococcus mutans (S.mutans), is considered the main pathogen causing 
      tooth decay. Sortase A (SrtA), one of the surface proteins of S. mutans, is a 
      potential target in the development of antimicrobial and caries prevention agents 
      for preventing infections associated with biofilm formation. Recently, various SrtA 
      inhibitors, including small molecules and natural product, especially, 
      trans-chalcone, chlorhexidine (CHX) and flavonoid compounds, which exhibit effective 
      inhibition against SrtA, have been identified. However, due to the limited number of 
      inhibitors, multi-drug resistance and side-effects the discovery of new inhibitors 
      for SrtA is essential. METHODS: In this case, various compounds aimed at the target 
      enzyme underwent high-throughput screening with small molecule libraries. For this 
      screening of a total of 178 compounds, 163 were found to be pharmacokinetically 
      suitable by performing an absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
      analysis. Molecular docking was then applied to investigate the interaction 
      mechanism among these suitable compounds and the target enzyme structure at the 
      molecular level. RESULTS: According to the results of the study, six compounds 
      (CHEMBL243796 (kurarinone), CHEMBL2180472, CHEMBL3335591, CHEMBL373249, 
      CHEMBL1395334, CHEMBL253467 (Isobavachalcone)) exhibited lower docking scores 
      (-7.18, -6.59, -6.53, -6.47, -6.43, and -6.39 kcal/mol, respectively) against S. 
      mutans SrtA than the positive control CHX (-6.29 kcal/mol). Finally, the 100 ns 
      molecular dynamic simulations and binding free energy calculations were performed 
      for the structure stability analysis of the enzyme with CHEMBL243796 (kurarinone), 
      which showed the lowest docking score. As a result of these studies, the stability 
      of the critical interactions between kurarinone and the target enzyme was preserved 
      during the simulation time. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that flavonoid and 
      chalcone scaffold compounds are clinically more reliable and potent than CHX as 
      novel inhibitory agents for inhibiting oral biofilm formation. These finding can 
      provide important contribution to the future clinical trials in the development of 
      therapeutically useful inhibitors of SrtA by virtually screening several chemical 
      compounds more rapidly to select suitable compounds for the prevention and treatment 
      of dental caries.

AB  - We report here a new strategy to enable fast, covalent, and site-directed 
      functionalization of protein nanoparticles using Sortase A-mediated ligation using 
      functional proteins ranging from monomeric to large tetrameric structures. Easy 
      purification of the modified E2 nanoparticles is achieved by functionalization with 
      a thermo-responsive elastin-like-peptide. The resulting protein nanoparticles 
      remained intact and active even after repeated phase transitions, suggesting their 
      use in biocatalysis, biosensing, and imaging applications.

      dispensable for microbial growth or viability, SrtA is considered a favorable target 
      for the enhancement of novel anti-infective drugs that aim to interfere with key 
      bacterial virulence mechanisms, such as biofilm formation, without developing drug 
      resistance. Here, we used virtual screening to search an in-house natural compound 
      library and identified two natural compounds, N1287 (Skyrin) and N2576 
      ((4,5-dichloro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-[2,4-dihydroxy-3-(4-methyl-pentyl)-phenyl]-methanone) 
      that inhibited the enzymatic activity of SrtA. These compounds also significantly 
      reduced the growth of S. aureus but possessed moderate mammalian toxicity. 
      Furthermore, S. aureus strains treated with these compounds exhibited reduction in 
      adherence to host fibrinogen, as well as biofilm formation. Hence, these compounds 
      may represent an anti-infective therapy without the side effects of antibiotics.

TI  - Sortase A-Generated Highly Potent Anti-CD20-MMAE Conjugates for Efficient 
      Elimination of B-Lineage Lymphomas.
LID - 10.1002/smll.201602267 [doi]
AB  - Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting antigens expressed on the surface of tumor 
      cells are an effective approach for delivering drugs into the cells via 
      antigen-mediated endocytosis. One of the well-known tumor antigens, the CD20 of 
      B-lymphocyte, has long been suggested to be noninternalizing epitope, and is thus 
      not considered a desirable target for ADCs. Here, sortase A (srtA)-mediated 
      transpeptidation is used to specifically conjugate triple glycine-modified 
      monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a highly toxic antimitotic agent, to anti-CD20 
      ofatumumab (OFA) equipped with a short C-terminal LPETG (5 amino acids) tag at heavy 
      chain (HL), which generates ADCs that show extremely strong potency in killing CD20 
      positive cancer cells. One of the srtA-generated ADCs with a cleavable dipeptide 
      linker (valine-citrulline, vc), OFA-HL-vcMMAE, shows IC50 values ranging from 5 pg 
      mL(-1) to 4.1 ng mL(-1) against CD20+ lymphoma cells. Confocal laser scanning 
      microscopy confirms that OFA-HL-vcMMAE internalization by Ramos cells is 
      significantly improved compared to OFA alone, consistent with the high antitumor 
      activity of the new ADC. OFA-HL-vcMMAE, at 5 mg kg(-1) dose, is able to eliminate 
      tumors with mean volume ≈400 mm(3) while no obvious drug-related toxicity is 
      observed. The results show that srtA-generated OFA-MMAE conjugate system provides a 
      viable strategy for targeting CD20+ B lineage lymphomas.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance resulting in ineffective treatment of infectious diseases 
      is an increasing global problem, particularly in infections with pathogenic 
      bacteria. In some bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, the pathogenicity is 
      strongly linked to the attachment of virulence factors. Their attachment to the 
      cellular membrane is a transpeptidation reaction, catalyzed by sortase enzymes. As 
      such, sortases pose an interesting target for the development of new antivirulence 
      strategies that could yield novel antimicrobial drugs. Using the 
      substitution-oriented fragment screening (SOS) approach, we discovered a potent and 
      specific inhibitor (C10) of sortase A from S. pyogenes. The inhibitor C10 showed 
      high specificity towards S. pyogenes sortase A, with an IC(50) value of 10 μM and a 
      K(d) of 60 μM. We envision that this inhibitor could be employed as a starting point 
      for further exploration of sortase's potential as therapeutic target for 
      antimicrobial drug development.

TI  - Structural Analysis of Sortase A Inhibitors.
LID - 1591
AB  - Bacterial sortases are cysteine transpeptidases that regulate the covalent linkage 
      of several surface protein virulence factors in Gram-positive bacteria. Virulence 
      factors play significant roles in adhesion, invasion of host tissues, biofilm 
      formation and immune evasion, mediating the bacterial pathogenesis and infectivity. 
      Therefore, sortases are emerging as important targets for the design of new 
      anti-infective agents. We employed a computational study, based on structure derived 
      descriptors and molecular fingerprints, in order to develop simple classification 
      methods which could allow predicting low active or high active SrtA inhibitors. Our 
      results indicate that a highly active SrtA inhibitor has a molecular weight ranging 
      between 180 and 600, contains one up to four nitrogen atoms, up to three oxygen 
      atoms and under 18 hydrogen atoms. Also the hydrogen acceptor number and the 
      molecular flexibility, as assessed by the number of rotatable bounds, have emerged 
      as the most relevant descriptors for SrtA affinity. The Bemis-Murcko scaffolding 
      revealed favoured scaffolds as containing at least two ring structures bonded 
      directly or merged in a condensed cycle. This data represent a valuable tool for 
      identifying new potent SrtA inhibitors, potential anti-virulence agents targeted 
      against Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant strains.

TI  - Preparation of Site-Specific Cytotoxic Protein Conjugates via Maleimide-thiol 
      Chemistry and Sortase A-Mediated Ligation.
LID - 10.3791/61918 [doi]
AB  - Cancer is currently the second most common cause of death worldwide. The hallmark of 
      cancer cells is the presence of specific marker proteins such as growth factor 
      receptors on their surface. This feature enables development of highly selective 
      therapeutics, the protein bioconjugates, composed of targeting proteins (antibodies 
      or receptor ligands) connected to highly cytotoxic drugs by a specific linker. Due 
      to very high affinity and selectivity of targeting proteins the bioconjugates 
      recognize marker proteins on the cancer cells surface and utilize receptor-mediated 
      endocytosis to reach the cell interior. Intracellular vesicular transport system 
      ultimately delivers the bioconjugates to the lysosomes, where proteolysis separates 
      free cytotoxic drugs from the proteinaceous core of the bioconjugates, triggering 
      drug-dependent cancer cell death. Currently, there are several protein bioconjugates 
      approved for cancer treatment and large number is under development or clinical 
      trials. One of the main challenges in the generation of the bioconjugates is a 
      site-specific attachment of the cytotoxic drug to the targeting protein. Recent 
      years have brought a tremendous progress in the development of chemical and 
      enzymatic strategies for protein modification with cytotoxic drugs. Here we present 
      the detailed protocols for the site-specific incorporation of cytotoxic warheads 
      into targeting proteins using a chemical method employing maleimide-thiol chemistry 
      and an enzymatic approach that relies on sortase A-mediated ligation. We use 
      engineered variant of fibroblast growth factor 2 and fragment crystallizable region 
      of human immunoglobulin G as an exemplary targeting proteins and monomethyl 
      auristatin E and methotrexate as model cytotoxic drugs. All the described strategies 
      allow for highly efficient generation of biologically active cytotoxic conjugates of 
      defined molecular architecture with potential for selective treatment of diverse 
      cancers.

TI  - A Novel Yeast Surface Display Method for Large-Scale Screen Inhibitors of Sortase A.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering4010006 [doi]
LID - 6
AB  - Fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrates of sortase A are too expensive to 
      be used to roughly screen high-throughput sortase A inhibitors. This makes 
      therapeutic strategies difficult to realize in a clinical therapeutic use. Instead, 
      we design here an LPETG-EGFP (leucine, proline, glutamic, threonine and 
      glycine-enhanced green fluorescence) protein displayed on a yeast surface as a 
      substrate by adaptively reducing the cost. We do this by optimizing the induction 
      conditions of sortase A expression in Escherichia coli DE3(BL21) and catalyzing 
      LPETG proteins, which are displayed on surface of Pichia pastoris. Different 
      expression conditions of sortase A include: induction temperature (22 °C, 28 °C, 37 
      °C and 40 °C), induction time (4 h, 5 h, 6 h and 7 h) and induction concentration of 
      isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside IPTG (0.25 mmol/L, 0.5 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L, and 2 
      mmol/L). The fluorescence change of the LPETG-EGFP protein on the surface of P. 
      pastoris over time was detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence 
      spectrophotometry, and then the sensitivities of the two methods were compared. 
      Using berberine chloride as an inhibitor, the activity of sortase A was investigated 
      with the substrates of LPETG-EGFP protein, and compared to Dabcyl-QALPETGEE-Edans. A 
      high yield of sortase A was achieved by inducing 1.0 mmol/L IPTG at 28 °C for 6 h. 
      The intensity of green fluorescence of substrates displayed on the yeast surface was 
      increased over time, while the stability was decreased slightly. Both fluorescence 
      spectrophotometery and flow cytometry were fit for detection because of their high 
      sensitivity. We utilized two different substrates of sortase A to investigate 
      sortase A activity, which resulted in the increase of fluorescence intensity with 
      respect to the increased time of growth. However, the method with 
      Dabcyl-QALPETGEE-Edans as its substrate was more robust. Thus, the method described 
      in this paper is a simple and cheap method which is very suitable for 
      high-throughput analysis, but the conventional method is much more sensitive. The 
      method described in this paper is expected to lead to large-scale screening of 
      sortase A inhibitors which can be used to decrease the risk of drug resistance 
      development.

AB  - Backbone cyclization has a profound impact on the biological activity and thermal 
      and proteolytic stability of proteins and peptides. Chemical methods for cyclization 
      are not always feasible, especially for large peptides or proteins. Recombinant 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A shows potential as a new tool for the cyclization of 
      both proteins and peptides. In this review, the scope and background of the 
      sortase-mediated cyclization are discussed. High efficiency, versatility, and easy 
      access make sortase A a promising cyclization tool, both for recombinant and 
      chemo-enzymatic production methods.

TI  - Domain selective labeling for NMR studies of multidomain proteins by domain ligation 
      using highly active sortase A.

AB  - Structural study of multidomain proteins using NMR is an emerging issue for 
      understanding biological functions. To this end, domain-specific labeling is 
      expected to be a key technology for facilitating the NMR-assignment process and for 
      collecting distance information via spin labeling. To obtain domain-specific labeled 
      samples, use of sortase A as a protein ligation tool is a viable approach. Sortase A 
      enables ligation of separately expressed proteins (domains) through the 
      Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly linker. However, the ligation reaction mediated by sortase A is 
      not efficient. Poor yield and long reaction times hamper large-scale preparation 
      using sortase A. Here we report the application of highly active sortases to NMR 
      analyses. Optimal yields can be achieved within several hours when the ligation 
      reaction are mediated by highly active sortases at 4 °C. We propose that this 
      protocol can contribute to structural analyses of multidomain proteins by NMR.

TI  - Sortase A as a novel molecular "stapler" for sequence-specific protein conjugation.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - The Sortase family of transpeptidase enzymes catalyzes sequence-specific ligation of 
      proteins to the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we describe the 
      application of recombinant Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A to attach a tagged model 
      protein substrate (green fluorescent protein) to polystyrene beads chemically 
      modified with either alkylamine or the in vivo Sortase A ligand, Gly-Gly-Gly, on 
      their surfaces. Furthermore, we show that Sortase A can be used to 
      sequence-specifically ligate eGFP to amino-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) and to 
      generate protein oligomers and cyclized monomers using suitably tagged eGFP. We find 
      that an alkylamine can substitute for the natural Gly3 substrate, which suggests the 
      possibility of using the enzyme in materials applications. The highly specific and 
      mild Sortase A-catalyzed reaction, based on small recognition tags unlikely to 
      interfere with protein expression, thus represents a useful addition to the protein 
      immobilization and modification tool kit.

TI  - Erianin against Staphylococcus aureus Infection via Inhibiting Sortase A.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10100385 [doi]
LID - 385
AB  - With continuous emergence and widespread of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus infections, common antibiotics have become ineffective in treating these 
      infections in the clinical setting. Anti-virulence strategies could be novel, 
      effective therapeutic strategies against drug-resistant bacterial infections. 
      Sortase A (srtA), a transpeptidase in gram-positive bacteria, can anchor surface 
      proteins that play a vital role in pathogenesis of these bacteria. SrtA is known as 
      a potential antivirulent drug target to treat bacterial infections. In this study, 
      we found that erianin, a natural bibenzyl compound, could inhibit the activity of 
      srtA in vitro (half maximal inhibitory concentration-IC(50) = 20.91 ± 2.31 μg/mL, 
      65.7 ± 7.2 μM) at subminimum inhibitory concentrations (minimum inhibitory 
      concentrations-MIC = 512 μg/mL against S. aureus). The molecular mechanism 
      underlying the inhibition of srtA by erianin was identified using molecular dynamics 
      simulation: erianin binds to srtA residues Ile182, Val193, Trp194, Arg197, and 
      Ile199, forming a stable bond via hydrophobic interactions. In addition, the 
      activities of S. aureus binding to fibronectin and biofilm formation were inhibited 
      by erianin, when co-culture with S. aureus. In vivo, erianin could improve the 
      survival in mice that infected with S. aureus by tail vein injection. Experimental 
      results showed that erianin is a potential novel therapeutic compound against S. 
      aureus infections via affecting srtA.

AB  - Gram-positive bacteria use sortase cysteine transpeptidase enzymes to covalently 
      attach proteins to their cell wall and to assemble pili. In pathogenic bacteria 
      sortases are potential drug targets, as many of the proteins that they display on 
      the microbial surface play key roles in the infection process. Moreover, the 
      Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A (SaSrtA) enzyme has been developed into a valuable 
      biochemical reagent because of its ability to ligate biomolecules together in vitro 
      via a covalent peptide bond. Here we review what is known about the structures and 
      catalytic mechanism of sortase enzymes. Based on their primary sequences, most 
      sortase homologs can be classified into six distinct subfamilies, called class A-F 
      enzymes. Atomic structures reveal unique, class-specific variations that support 
      alternate substrate specificities, while structures of sortase enzymes bound to 
      sorting signal mimics shed light onto the molecular basis of substrate recognition. 
      The results of computational studies are reviewed that provide insight into how key 
      reaction intermediates are stabilized during catalysis, as well as the mechanism and 
      dynamics of substrate recognition. Lastly, the reported in vitro activities of 
      sortases are compared, revealing that the transpeptidation activity of SaSrtA is at 
      least 20-fold faster than other sortases that have thus far been characterized. 
      Together, the results of the structural, computational, and biochemical studies 
      discussed in this review begin to reveal how sortases decorate the microbial surface 
      with proteins and pili, and may facilitate ongoing efforts to discover 
      therapeutically useful small molecule inhibitors.

TI  - Development of a Sortase A-mediated Peptide-labeled Liposome Applicable to 
      Drug-delivery Systems.
PG  - 4411-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: In order to develop an efficient drug-delivery system (DDS), a 
      lipopeptide-loaded liposome that functions as a platform for the transpeptidase 
      reaction mediated by sortase A (SrtA) was constructed and its stability, as well as 
      cell-specific targeting were evaluated in the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Several lipopeptides possessing an acceptor peptide sequence (oligoglycine ≥ three 
      residues) or donor peptide sequence (LPETG) for the SrtA-mediated reaction were 
      chemically synthesized and then inserted into the liposome membrane composed of 
      1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and cholesterol (DPPC-Chol-lipo) 
      to obtain the lipopeptide-loaded liposomes. The transpeptidase reaction mediated by 
      recombinant SrtA (His-ΔN59SrtA) was employed to modify the peptide moiety on the 
      liposomal surface using a fluorescently-labeled substrate peptide corresponding to 
      the species of each loaded lipopeptide. Furthermore, lung tumor-binding peptide 
      (LTBP)-labeled liposomes, prepared by this transpeptidase reaction, were 
      investigated for selective targeting to lung cancer cells in vitro. RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: The His-ΔN59SrtA-mediated transpeptidation of fluorescently-labeled 
      peptide on the lipopeptide-loaded DPPC-Chol-lipo was confirmed. The selective 
      targeting of LTBP-labeled liposomes to the lung cancer cell line A549 was also 
      observed in vitro. These results suggest that the labeling of acceptor or donor 
      lipopeptide-loaded liposomes with the transpeptidase SrtA could be a useful method 
      for developing a platform applicable to a cancer-targeting DDS.

TI  - NMR structure-based optimization of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A pyridazinone 
      inhibitors.
PG  - 327-344
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12962 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections in the USA 
      and is a major health concern as methicillin-resistant S. aureus and other 
      antibiotic-resistant strains are common. Compounds that inhibit the S. aureus 
      sortase (SrtA) cysteine transpeptidase may function as potent anti-infective agents 
      as this enzyme attaches virulence factors to the bacterial cell wall. While a 
      variety of SrtA inhibitors have been discovered, the vast majority of these small 
      molecules have not been optimized using structure-based approaches. Here we have 
      used NMR spectroscopy to determine the molecular basis through which 
      pyridazinone-based small molecules inhibit SrtA. These inhibitors covalently modify 
      the active cysteine thiol and partially mimic the natural substrate of SrtA by 
      inducing the closure of an active site loop. Computational and synthetic chemistry 
      methods led to second-generation analogues that are ~70-fold more potent than the 
      lead molecule. These optimized molecules exhibit broad-spectrum activity against 
      other types of class A sortases, have reduced cytotoxicity, and impair SrtA-mediated 
      protein display on S. aureus cell surface. Our work shows that pyridazinone 
      analogues are attractive candidates for further development into anti-infective 
      agents, and highlights the utility of employing NMR spectroscopy and 
      solubility-optimized small molecules in structure-based drug discovery.

AB  - We have examined quantitatively the efficiency and the kinetics of sortase 
      A-mediated coupling of model substrate proteins (derived from green fluorescent 
      protein and the SNAP variant of O-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase) to large 
      unilamellar liposomes incorporating low levels of oligopeptide-modified acceptor 
      lipids. Under normal reaction conditions, even using high concentrations of S. 
      aureus or S. pyogenes sortase A and optimal protein coupling substrates and acceptor 
      lipids, protein-liposome coupling is slow, gives at best modest coupling yields, and 
      is markedly limited by the hydrolytic activity of sortase. We demonstrate, however, 
      that these limitations can be overcome under "prebinding" conditions that promote 
      initial reversible association of sortase and the substrate protein with the 
      liposome surface. Using oligohistidine-tagged sortase and substrate proteins and 
      liposomes incorporating an acceptor lipid together with a Ni(II)-chelating lipid 
      derivative, high coupling rates and yields can be obtained at low sortase 
      concentrations, while virtually eliminating adverse effects of sortase hydrolytic 
      activity on protein coupling. The prebinding approach described here can readily be 
      adapted, and if necessary rendered virtually "traceless", to accommodate diverse 
      protein coupling substrates and end uses of the protein-modified liposomes.

TI  - An intramembrane sensory circuit monitors sortase A-mediated processing of 
      streptococcal adhesins.
LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aas9941 [doi]
LID - eaas9941
AB  - Bacterial adhesins mediate adhesion to substrates and biofilm formation. Adhesins of 
      the LPXTG family are posttranslationally processed by the cell membrane-localized 
      peptidase sortase A, which cleaves the LPXTG motif. This generates a short 
      C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature 
      adhesin is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding adhesins of the oral 
      bacterium Streptococcus gordonii were differentially expressed depending on whether 
      the bacteria were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be 
      coordinately regulated. Deletion of sspA and sspB (sspAB), both of which encode 
      LPXTG-containing adhesins, unexpectedly enhanced adhesion and biofilm formation. 
      C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing adhesin localized to the cell membrane 
      and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus 
      preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of 
      SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the scaCBA operon encoding the lipoprotein 
      adhesin ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance biofilm formation. 
      This C-pep-driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is 
      likely conserved among Gram-positive bacteria. This quality control mechanism 
      ensures that the bacteria can form biofilms under diverse environmental conditions 
      and may play a role in optimizing adhesion and biofilm formation.

      co-solvents. MD simulations revealed that conformational mobilities are important 
      for the gained resistance.

TI  - A potential bio-control agent from baical skullcap root against listeriosis via the 
      inhibition of sortase A and listeriolysin O.
PG  - 2042-2051
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.14110 [doi]
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is a classical model intracellular pathogen and the 
      leading cause of listeriosis, which has long been a global public health issue. The 
      successful infection of LM is related to a series of virulence factors, such as the 
      transpeptidase enzyme sortase A (SrtA) and listeriolysin O (LLO), which are crucial 
      for bacterial internalization and escape from phagosomes respectively. It is 
      speculated that targeting multiple virulence factors may be due to a synergistic 
      effect on listeriosis therapy. In this study, an active flavonoids component of 
      Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, baicalein, was found to potently block both 
      listerial SrtA catalyzed activity and LLO hemolytic activity within 16 μg/mL. After 
      pretreatment with baicalein, 86.30 (±11.35) % of LM failed to associate with Caco-2 
      cells compared to the LM without preincubation (regarded as 100% internalization). 
      Furthermore, baicalein addition may aid in bacterial degradation and clearance in 
      macrophagocytes. During a 5 h observation, LM in cells incubated with baicalein 
      showed significantly decreased vacuole escapes and sluggish endocellular growth. In 
      addition, baicalein directly prevented LM-induced cells injury and mice fatality 
      (survival rate from 10.00% to 54.55% in 4 days post-intraperitoneal injection). 
      Taken together, as an antagonist against SrtA and LLO, baicalein can be further 
      developed into a biotherapeutic agent for listeriosis.

AB  - Self-adjuvanting vaccines, consisting of recombinant protein antigens and covalently 
      attached Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, have the ability to simultaneously and 
      efficiently deliver antigen and TLR adjuvant to antigen presenting cells (APCs). 
      Here, an enzyme-mediated ligation approach was used to overcome difficulties in 
      producing homogeneous, molecularly defined self-adjuvanting vaccine products under 
      native conditions. This process was optimized to allow the incorporation of the 
      lipopeptide TLR2 agonist fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide (FSL)-1 onto the N- or 
      C-termini of recombinant protein antigens, employing the enzyme Staphylococcus 
      aureus sortase A (SrtAsa) penta mutant. In addition, because SrtAsa-mediated 
      ligations are reversible, a tryptophan zipper derived sequence was introduced into 
      both reactants, which was demonstrated to improve ligation efficiency through the 
      formation of a β-hairpin structure that hinders the reverse reaction. Finally, it 
      was demonstrated that N- or C-terminal conjugation, and the incorporation of the 
      β-hairpin structure, did not affect the TLR2-agonist activities of protein antigen 
      TLR agonist conjugates. Overall, this SrtAsa-mediated ligation platform enabled 
      production of antigen TLR2 agonist conjugates with enhanced ligation efficiency, 
      with the conjugates demonstrating potent TLR2 signaling activation (EC(50) <1nM).

TI  - Expanding the Scope of Sortase-Mediated Ligations by Using Sortase Homologues.
PG  - 185-195
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201700517 [doi]
AB  - Sortase-catalyzed transacylation reactions are widely used for the construction of 
      non-natural protein derivatives. However, the most commonly used enzyme for these 
      strategies (sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus) is limited by its narrow substrate 
      scope. To expand the range of substrates compatible with sortase-mediated reactions, 
      we characterized the in vitro substrate preferences of eight sortase A homologues. 
      From these studies, we identified sortase A enzymes that recognize multiple 
      substrates that are unreactive toward sortase A from S. aureus. We further exploited 
      the ability of sortase A from Streptococcus pneumoniae to recognize an LPATS 
      substrate to perform a site-specific modification of the N-terminal serine residue 
      in the naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide DCD-1L. Finally, we unexpectedly 
      observed that certain substrates (LPATXG, X=Nle, Leu, Phe, Tyr) were susceptible to 
      transacylation at alternative sites within the substrate motif, and sortase A from 
      S. pneumoniae was capable of forming oligomers. Overall, this work provides a 
      foundation for the further development of sortase enzymes for use in protein 
      modification.

TI  - Sortase A promotes virulence in experimental Staphylococcus lugdunensis 
      endocarditis.
PG  - 2141-2152
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.070292-0 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a commensal of humans and an opportunistic pathogen. 
      It can cause an aggressive form of infective endocarditis in healthy humans akin to 
      Staphylococcus aureus. Here we compared the virulence of the genome-sequenced S. 
      lugdunensis strain N920143 to S. aureus in an experimental rat endocarditis model. 
      N920143 caused a milder course of disease with lower levels of bacteraemia and 
      smaller endocardial vegetations than S. aureus strain Newman. However, vegetations 
      were comparable to those produced by S. aureus MRSA strain COL. Little is known 
      about virulence factors of S. lugdunensis as systems to manipulate the bacterium 
      genetically are currently limited. Here, we report a method for electroporation of 
      S. lugdunensis with plasmid DNA and demonstrate that the low efficiency of 
      transformation is due to the activity of a conserved type I restriction-modification 
      system. To streamline the transformation process, we constructed SL01B, an E. coli 
      strain expressing the hsdM/hsdS genes of N920143. Modified plasmid DNA isolated from 
      SL01B transformed S. lugdunensis strains from clonal complexes 1 and 2 efficiently. 
      A deletion mutant of N920143 lacking sortase A was significantly less virulent than 
      the wild-type in the endocarditis model. Mutants defective in single surface 
      proteins Fbl or vWbl were not significantly different from the wild-type but showed 
      trends towards reduced virulence.

AB  - A microparticle surface was designed by the unique method incorporating 
      streptavidin-biotin affinity and sortase A (SrtA)-catalyzed transpeptidation. 
      Leucine-proline-glutamate-threonine-glycine-tagged streptavidin (Stav-LPETG)was 
      immobilized on the surface using streptavidin-biotin affinity, and GGGGG-tagged red 
      fluorescent protein (Gly5-RFP) was conjugated with SrtA. Biotinylated fluorescein 
      isothiocyanate (biotin-FITC) was then bound to residual biotin-binding sites in 
      Stav-LPETG. The resulting particles had RFP and FITC immobilized on the surface via 
      Stav-LPETG, and RFP- and FITC-associated fluorescence was observed using 
      fluorescence microscopy. Finally, GGG-tagged glucose oxidase and biotinylated 
      horseradish peroxidase were immobilized on the microparticle surface, resulting in a 
      functional particle capable of detecting glucose. This particle can be repeatedly 
      used and is more sensitive in detecting glucose than particles prepared using 
      chemical modification. Our method provides a simple strategy for site-specific 
      coimmobilization on molecular surfaces and expands the use of protein hybrid 
      devices.

PG  - 1136-1145
LID - 10.1002/ddr.21599 [doi]
AB  - Three natural naphthoquinones were screened to find new anti-virulence agents as 
      inhibitors against sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus (SaSrtA) by quantifying the 
      increase in fluorescence intensity upon substrate cleavage at various 
      concentrations. The 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione derivatives, juglone and 
      plumbagin, demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect, with IC(50) values of 1.78 μM, 
      respectively, 16.71 μM. The related 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione derivative, 
      lawsone, demonstrated the selectivity of the chemical scaffold having no significant 
      effect on SaSrtA. The experimental assay was reinforced by molecular docking 
      experiments, antimicrobial, and toxicological studies. Molecular docking studies and 
      the electrophilic character analysis suggest bonding to the enzyme active cysteine 
      residue by a Michael addition reaction. None of the compounds had a significant 
      effect on the concentration of total thiol proteins in the Daphnia magna 
      toxicological assay after 24 hr exposure. Juglone and plumbagin moderately inhibited 
      biofilm formation with no significant effect on bacterial growth of S. aureus, 
      Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, indicating a selective 
      anti-virulence profile.

TI  - Discovery of Sortase A covalent inhibitors with benzofuranene cyanide structures as 
      potential antibacterial agents against Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a cysteine transpeptidase of most gram-positive bacteria that is 
      responsible for the anchoring of many surface protein virulence factors to the cell 
      wall. SrtA ablation has demonstrated to alleviate the infection without affecting 
      the viability of bacteria. Herein, a series of benzofuran cyanide derivatives were 
      synthesized and evaluated. Several compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activity 
      against SrtA with IC(50) values from 3.3 μM to 21.8 μM compared with the known SrtA 
      inhibitor pHMB (IC(50) = 130 μM). Ⅲ-1, Ⅲ-15, Ⅲ-34 and V-1 showed potent inhibitory 
      effects on biofilm formation with IC(50) values from 2.1 μM to 54.2 μM. Invasion 
      assays showed the four compounds caused a decrease of 4%-24.0% in the uptake of the 
      S. aureus strain by 293T cells. Further assay showed that compound Ⅲ-15 decreased 
      the amount of cell wall-associated protein A by 26.5%. Structure-activity 
      relationship and docking studies demonstrated that the acrylonitrile moiety of the 
      compounds played an important role in enhancing the activity. When the double bond 
      of acrylonitrile changed to single bond, the activity was decreased significantly. 
      This indicates that acrylonitrile, which is a Michael receptor, can inhibit the 
      activity of SrtA by covalent binding effectively to the thiol group of Cys184.

AB  - Increasing antimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern. Conventional 
      antibiotics apply selection pressures, which promote the accumulation of resistant 
      microbes. Anti-virulence strategies, in contrast, are less potent antimicrobials, 
      but are less likely to select for resistance, can be combined with existing 
      antibiotics to improve their activity, and in some cases can overcome antimicrobial 
      resistance towards other antimicrobials. Sortase A inhibitors (SrtAIs) represent an 
      exciting example of this class; however, many reported examples demonstrate poor 
      water solubility, which complicates their biological assessment and activity. This 
      includes reports that use antimicrobial concentrations of organic solvents or 
      conditions that fail to solubilise these compounds for minimal inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) assessments. Herein, we report the first study to optimise 
      screening processes for a library of prospective SrtAIs (trans-chalcone (TC), 
      berberine (BR), curcumin (CUR), and quercetin (QC)), including comparative 
      assessment of the effects of various co-solvent concentrations, along with 
      comparative assessment of their antimicrobial activities against multiple disease 
      relevant bacterial strains (methicillin-sensitive and resistant S. aureus, E. coli, 
      and P. aeruginosa), inhibition of the sortase A enzyme, and toxicity towards 
      mammalian cells (HEK-293), using these optimised conditions. Optimal solubility with 
      minimal effect on bacterial viability was observed in the presence of 5% (v/v) 
      dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-Mueller-Hinton Broth. Three antimicrobial susceptibility 
      tests (broth microdilution, agar dilution, and disk diffusion) were assessed for 
      their ability to accurately determine minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) data 
      for each SrtAI. Broth microdilution and agar dilution were both effective; however, 
      the broth microdilution assay required the addition of a colorimetric metabolic 
      indicator (resazurin) to enable simple and reliable MIC determination due to the 
      development of precipitants over time. In contrast, disk diffusion did not provide 
      reliable zone of inhibition data. Identical MIC data was observed with 
      methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus (MRSA; ATCC43300), with lower potency 
      activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Under these conditions, TC and CUR 
      demonstrated significant toxicity towards human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, 
      with QC showing less toxicity and BR limited-to-no toxicity at its MIC. Overall, the 
      findings of this work provide optimised processes, which will prove useful for the 
      study of other poorly soluble antimicrobial agents and SrtAIs. The obtained data 
      suggests that BR should be considered in preference to the other SrtAIs for the 
      development of new antimicrobial formulations, based on its superior antimicrobial 
      and SrtA inhibition potency, and greatly reduced toxicity.

AB  - Bioorthogonal, chemoselective ligation methods are an essential part of the tools 
      utilized to investigate biochemical pathways. Specifically enzymatic approaches are 
      valuable methods in this context due to the inherent specificity of the deployed 
      enzymes and the mild conditions of the modification reactions. One of the most 
      common strategies is based on the transpeptidation catalyzed by sortase A derived 
      from Staphylococcus aureus. The procedure is well established and a wide variety of 
      applications have been published to date. Here, implementations of sortase A, which 
      range from protein labeling using fluorescence dyes and the preparation of cyclic 
      proteins to the modification of entire cells, are summarized. Furthermore, there is 
      a focus on the optimization approaches established to solve the drawbacks of 
      sortase-mediated transpeptidation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study intends to explore the mechanism underlying the support of 
      sortase A (SrtA) of the cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). METHODS: 
      We performed a metabonomics study based on ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy (NMR), in which we compared the extracellular metabolites of wild-type 
      S. mutans UA159 with those of its SrtA-deficient strain. Metabolite differences 
      among strains were identified using a combination of principal component analysis 
      and orthogonality partial least square discriminant analysis. RESULTS: Several 
      differences corresponding mostly to unknown metabolites were identified. Some amino 
      acids such as leucine and valine (δ 0.92×10⁻⁶-1.20×10⁻⁶), lactic acid ( δ1.28×10⁻⁶), 
      oxoglutaric acid (δ 3.00×10⁻⁶), and glycine (δ 3.60×10⁻⁶) differed among strains. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This work establishes the feasibility of using ¹H NMR-based 
      metabonomics to provide leads for research into molecular factors that promote 
      caries. The database of microbial metabolites should be also improved in further 
      studies.

TI  - High-Throughput Generation of Bispecific Binding Proteins by Sortase A-Mediated 
      Coupling for Direct Functional Screening in Cell Culture.

LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0633 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput construction of multivalent binders and subsequent screening for 
      biological activity represent a fundamental challenge: A linear increase of 
      monovalent components translates to the square of possible bivalent combinations. 
      Even high-efficiency cloning and expression methods become limiting when thousands 
      of bispecific binders need to be screened for activity. In this study, we present an 
      in vitro method for the efficient production of flexibly linked bispecific binding 
      agents from individually expressed and purified monovalent binders. We established a 
      sortase A-mediated coupling reaction to generate bispecific designed ankyrin repeat 
      proteins (DARPins), with an optimized reaction maximizing the bivalent coupling 
      product with low levels of monovalent side-products. These one-pot reaction mixtures 
      could be used directly, without further purification, in cell-based assays. We 
      generated a matrix of 441 different bispecific DARPins against the extracellular 
      domains of the cancer-associated receptors EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, EpCAM, and 
      c-MET and screened on two different ErbB2-positive cancer cells lines for 
      growth-inhibitory effects. We identified not only known but also novel biologically 
      active biparatopic DARPins. Furthermore, we found that the cancer cell lines respond 
      in a highly reproducible and defined manner to the treatment with the 441 different 
      bivalent binding agents. The generated response profiles can thus be used for 
      functional characterization of cell lines because they are strongly related to the 
      cell line-specific surface receptor landscape. Thus, our method not only represents 
      a robust tool for screening and lead identification of bispecific binding agents, 
      but additionally offers an orthogonal approach for the functional characterization 
      of cancer cell lines.

      Evaluation and Molecular Docking.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22111827 [doi]
LID - 1827
AB  - Sortase A inhibition is a well establish strategy for decreasing bacterial virulence 
      by affecting numerous key processes that control biofilm formation, host cell entry, 
      evasion and suppression of the immune response and acquisition of essential 
      nutrients. A meta-analysis of structures known to act as Sortase A inhibitors 
      provided the starting point for identifying a new potential scaffold. Based on this 
      template a series of new potential Sortase A inhibitors, that contain the 
      2-phenylthiazole moiety, were synthesized. The physicochemical characterisation 
      confirmed the identity of the proposed structures. Antibacterial activity evaluation 
      showed that the new compounds have a reduced activity against bacterial cell 
      viability. However, the compounds prevent biofilm formation at very low 
      concentrations, especially in the case of E. faecalis. Molecular docking studies 
      performed estimate that this is most likely due to the inhibition of Sortase A. The 
      new compounds could be used as add-on therapies together with known antibacterial 
      agents in order to combat multidrug-resistance enterococcal infections.

TI  - Sortase-Mediated High-Throughput Screening Platform for Directed Enzyme Evolution.
PG  - 203-211
LID - 10.1021/acscombsci.7b00153 [doi]
AB  - Sortase-catalyzed ligations have emerged as powerful tools for the site-specific 
      ligation of peptides and proteins in material science and biocatalysis. In this 
      work, a directed sortase evolution strategy (SortEvolve) has been developed as a 
      general high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to improve activity of sortase A 
      (application 1) and to perform directed laccase evolution through a semipurification 
      process in 96-well microtiter plate (MTP) (application 2). A semipurification 
      process in polypropylene MTP (PP-MTP) is achieved through the anchor peptide LCI, 
      which acts as adhesion promoter. To validate the SortEvolve screening platform for 
      both applications, three site-saturation mutagenesis (SSM) libraries of sortase A 
      (Sa-SrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus (application 1) and two SSM libraries of the 
      copper efflux oxidase (CueO laccase) from Escherichia coli (application 2) were 
      generated at literature reported positions. After screening and rescreening, an 
      array of Sa-SrtA variants (including the previously reported P94S, D160N, and D165A) 
      and CueO variants (including the previously reported D439A and P444A) were 
      identified. Further recombinant Sa-SrtA variant P94T/D160L/D165Q and CueO variant 
      D439V/P444V were characterized with 22-fold and 103-fold improvements in catalytic 
      efficiency compared with corresponding wild-types, respectively. An important 
      advantage of the SortEvolve screening platform in comparison to many MTP-based 
      screening systems is that the background noise was minimized (decreased 20-fold; 
      application 2) due to the employed semipurification process. In essence, SortEvolve 
      provides a universal surface-functionalized screening platform for sortases and 
      enzymes in which especially background activity can be minimized to enable 
      successful directed evolution campaigns.

TI  - Hepta-Mutant Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A (SrtA(7m)) as a Tool for in Vivo 
      Protein Labeling in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 664-673
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.6b00998 [doi]
AB  - In vivo protein ligation is of emerging interest as a means of endowing proteins 
      with new properties in a controlled fashion. Tools to site-specifically and 
      covalently modify proteins with small molecules, peptides, or other proteins in 
      living cells are few and far between. Here, we describe the development of a 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase (SrtA)-based protein ligation approach for 
      site-specific conjugation of fluorescent dyes and ubiquitin (Ub) to modify proteins 
      in Caenorhabditis elegans. Hepta-mutant SrtA (SrtA(7m)) expressed in C. elegans is 
      functional and supports in vitro sortase reactions in a low-Ca(2+) environment. 
      Feeding SrtA(7m)-expressing C. elegans with small peptide-based probes such as 
      (Gly)(3)- biotin or (Gly)(3)-fluorophores enables in vivo target protein 
      modification. SrtA(7m) also catalyzes the circularization of suitably modified 
      linear target proteins in vivo and allows the installation of F-box domains on 
      targets to induce their degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. This is a 
      noninvasive method to achieve in vivo protein labeling, protein circularization, and 
      targeted degradation in C. elegans. This technique should improve our ability to 
      monitor and alter the function of intracellular proteins in vivo.

AB  - N-myristoylation is the covalent addition of a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid 
      (myristate) to the N-terminal glycine of specific protein substrates by 
      N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) and plays an important role in protein regulation by 
      controlling localization, stability, and interactions. We developed a novel method 
      for whole-proteome profiling of free N-terminal glycines through labeling with S. 
      Aureus sortase A (SrtA) and used it for assessment of target engagement by an NMT 
      inhibitor. Analysis of the SrtA-labeling pattern with an engineered biotinylated 
      depsipeptide SrtA substrate (Biotin-ALPET-Haa, Haa = 2-hydroxyacetamide) enabled 
      whole proteome identification and quantification of de novo generated N-terminal Gly 
      proteins in response to NMT inhibition by nanoLC-MS/MS proteomics, and was confirmed 
      for specific substrates across multiple cell lines by gel-based analyses and ELISA. 
      To achieve optimal signal over background noise we introduce a novel and generally 
      applicable improvement to the biotin/avidin affinity enrichment step by chemically 
      dimethylating commercial NeutrAvidin resin and combining this with two-step LysC 
      on-bead/trypsin off-bead digestion, effectively eliminating avidin-derived tryptic 
      peptides and enhancing identification of enriched peptides. We also report SrtA 
      substrate specificity in whole-cell lysates for the first time, confirming SrtA 
      promiscuity beyond its recognized preference for N-terminal glycine, and its 
      usefulness as a tool for unbiased labeling of N-terminal glycine-containing 
      proteins. Our new methodology is complementary to metabolic tagging strategies, 
      providing the first approach for whole proteome gain-of signal readout for NMT 
      inhibition in complex samples which are not amenable to metabolic tagging.

TI  - Sortase-Dependent Proteins Promote Gastrointestinal Colonization by Enterococci.
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00853-18 [doi]
LID - e00853-18
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is inhabited by a dense microbial community 
      of symbionts. Enterococci are among the earliest members of this community and 
      remain core members of the GIT microbiota throughout life. Enterococci have also 
      recently emerged as opportunistic pathogens and major causes of nosocomial 
      infections. Although recognized as a prerequisite for infection, colonization of the 
      GIT by enterococci remains poorly understood. One way that bacteria adapt to dynamic 
      ecosystems like the GIT is through the use of their surface proteins to sense and 
      interact with components of their immediate environment. In Gram-positive bacteria, 
      a subset of surface proteins relies on an enzyme called sortase for covalent 
      attachment to the cell wall. Here, we show that the housekeeping sortase A (SrtA) 
      enzyme promotes intestinal colonization by enterococci. Furthermore, we show that 
      the enzymatic activity of SrtA is key to the ability of Enterococcus faecalis to 
      bind mucin (a major component of the GIT mucus). We also report the GIT colonization 
      phenotypes of E. faecalis mutants lacking selected sortase-dependent proteins 
      (SDPs). Further examination of the mucin binding ability of these mutants suggests 
      that adhesion to mucin contributes to intestinal colonization by E. faecalis.

AB  - Bacteria possess complex and varying cell walls with many surface exposed proteins. 
      Sortases are responsible for the covalent attachment of specific proteins to the 
      peptidoglycan of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Sortase A of 
      Staphylococcus aureus, which is seen as the archetypal sortase, has been shown to be 
      essential for pathogenesis and has therefore received much attention as a potential 
      target for novel therapeutics. Being widely present in Gram-positive bacteria, it is 
      likely that other Gram-positive pathogens also require sortases for their 
      pathogenesis. Sortases have also been shown to be of significant use in a range of 
      industrial applications. We review current knowledge of the sortase family in terms 
      of their structures, functions and mechanisms and summarize work towards their use 
      as antibacterial targets and microbiological tools.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA)-catalyzed anchorage of surface proteins in most Gram-positive 
      bacteria is indispensable for their virulence, suggesting that this transpeptidase 
      is a promising target for antivirulence therapy. Here, an oligopeptide, LPRDA, was 
      identified as an effective inhibitor of SrtA via virtual screening based on the 
      LPXTG substrate sequence, and it was found to inhibit SrtA activity in vitro and in 
      vivo (IC(50) = 10.61 μM) by competitively occupying the active site of SrtA. 
      Further, the oligopeptide treatment had no anti-Staphylococcus aureus activity, but 
      it provided protection against S. aureus-induced mastitis in a mouse model. These 
      findings indicate that the oligopeptide could be used as an effective anti-infective 
      agent for the treatment of infection caused by S. aureus or other Gram-positive 
      bacteria via the targeting of SrtA.

      moieties as a common structural motif, while their cores varied [cyclopentenedione 
      (1-5), dihydrofuran (6 and 7), pyranone (8), and furanone (9)], reflecting different 
      extents of rearrangement and oxidation. Several of these compounds exhibited weak 
      antibacterial activities and moderate abilities to inhibit the microbial enzymes 
      sortase A and isocitrate lyase.

AB  - Catalytic metallopeptides that target the membrane-associated sortase A 
      transpeptidase have been developed and evaluated as irreversible inactivators of 
      SrtA∆N59 (sortase A, lacking the initial membrane-binding domain). The 
      copper-binding GGH tripeptide ATCUN motif was linked to amidated forms of the cell 
      wall sorting signal, LPET and LPETG, as sortase-targeting moieties. The resulting 
      metallopeptides were used to determine half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) 
      and rate constants for time-dependent sortase A inactivation. Michaelis-Menten 
      behavior was observed for the catalytic metallopeptides, and k(cat), K(M) and 
      k(cat)/K(M) parameters were obtained as 0.080 ± 0.002 min⁻¹, 23 ± 2 μM and 0.0035 ± 
      0.0003 μM⁻¹ min⁻¹, respectively. Concentration-dependent inhibition of SrtA∆N59 by 
      the metallopeptides revealed IC₅₀ values ranging from 570 to 700 µM, while Cu-GGH, 
      which lacked a targeting motif, had no measurable IC₅₀ value (>2,000 µM). 
      Time-dependent inactivation of SrtA revealed a range of catalytic activities, with 
      Cu-GGHGLPETG-NH2 demonstrating the fastest rate of inactivation in the presence of 
      ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide coreactants. The active site of the enzyme comprises 
      residues Cys-184, Arg-197 and His-120. LC-MS/MS analysis of the reaction products 
      demonstrated modification of Cys-184 to cysteine sulfonic acid (+48 amu). Results 
      obtained from a DTNB assay support oxidation of the Cys-184 residue. LC-MS/MS also 
      suggested oxidation of the Arg-197 containing peptide. 2D NMR analysis was performed 
      to assess the possible oxidation of His-120, however, none was observed. These 
      compounds possess the potential for irreversible inactivation of SrtA through 
      oxidative modification of essential residues required for substrate binding.

AB  - Sortase-mediated ligation (sortagging) is a versatile, powerful strategy for protein 
      modification. Because the sortase reaction reaches equilibrium, a large excess of 
      polyglycine nucleophile is often employed to drive the reaction forward and suppress 
      sortase-mediated side reactions. A flow-based sortagging platform employing 
      immobilized sortase A within a microreactor was developed that permits efficient 
      sortagging at low nucleophile concentrations. The platform was tested with several 
      reaction partners and used to generate a protein bioconjugate inaccessible by 
      solution-phase batch sortagging.

TI  - Sec translocase and sortase A are colocalised in a locus in the cytoplasmic membrane 
      of Streptococcus mutans.
PG  - 150-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The general secretory (Sec) pathway is the main pathway for protein 
      transport. Sortase A has been shown to anchor surface protein containing an LPXTG 
      motif to the cell wall. In order to know the distribution pattern of the Sec 
      translocons and sortase A in Streptococcus mutans, we explored the subcellular 
      localisation of SecA and sortase A. METHODS: The anti-SecA antibody and anti-sortase 
      A antibody were examined on Western blots to evaluate specificities. An indirect 
      post-embedding immunogold method was used to determine the subcellular localisation 
      of the Sec pathway and sortase A enzyme in S. mutans membrane. RESULTS: 
      Immunoblotting experiments showed that the anti-SecA antibody and anti-sortase A 
      antibody specifically recognised a single band of about 95 kDa and 27 kDa, 
      respectively in the S. mutans GS-5 cell lysates. Immunogold electron micrographs 
      showed that small and large gold particles clustered together at a distinct 
      microdomain. CONCLUSIONS: These data showed for the first time that Sec translocase 
      and sortase A colocalised to a single locus in the cytoplasmic membrane of S. mutans 
      GS-5.

PG  - 1883-1892
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.0c00322 [doi]
AB  - Protein immobilization has gained high interest in recent years for its valuable 
      applications in life sciences involving drug delivery and protein arrays. Herein, we 
      combine sortase-mediated protein immobilization with the versatility of magnetic 
      nanoparticles and a sensitive GFP-based quantification system. Using this method, we 
      successfully immobilized and quantified the amount of coupled enzymes by 
      fluorescence spectroscopy and assessed their activity by kinetic measurements. We 
      show that sortase-mediated coupling of enzymes enables preparation of biological 
      samples with a high demand of purity as demonstrated by single-molecule FRET. Here, 
      we report that sortase-mediated protein ligation allows both N- and C-terminal 
      site-specific protein immobilization. Additionally, we demonstrate that 
      sortase-mediated protein immobilization is suitable for direct protein 
      immobilization from complex lysates. Direct immobilization from lysate allows study 
      of enzyme functionality without the need of time-consuming enzyme purification, 
      while magnetic nanoparticles permit easy addition and removal of coupled enzymes to 
      and from a reaction mixture.

PG  - 2957-61
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01516-08 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae sortase A (SrtA) is a transpeptidase that is highly 
      conserved among pneumococcal strains, whose involvement in adhesion/colonization has 
      been reported. We found that intraperitoneal immunization with recombinant SrtA 
      conferred to mice protection against S. pneumoniae intraperitoneal challenge and 
      that the passive transfer of immune serum before intraperitoneal challenge was also 
      protective. Moreover, by using the intranasal challenge model, we observed a 
      significant reduction of bacteremia when mice were intraperitoneally immunized with 
      SrtA, while a moderate decrease of lung infection was achieved by intranasal 
      immunization, even though no influence on nasopharynx colonization was seen. Taken 
      together, our results suggest that SrtA is a good candidate for inclusion in a 
      multicomponent, protein-based, pneumococcal vaccine.

PG  - 396-402
LID - 10.1007/s12010-013-0378-9 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) forms part of the commensal microflora and is 
      deemed to be the major pathogen responsible for the generation of dental caries. The 
      enzyme, sortase A enzyme, modulates the surface properties and cariogenicity of S. 
      mutans. Curcumin has been reported to be an inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus 
      sortase A. In this study, inhibition of a purified S. mutans UA159 sortase A by 
      curcumin was evaluated. Curcumin exerted strong inhibitory activity with a half 
      maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10.2 ± 0.7 μM which was lower than the 
      minimum inhibitory concentration of 175 μM and the minimum bactericidal 
      concentration of 350 μM. These results indicated that curcumin is a S. mutans UA159 
      sortase A inhibitor and therefore represents as a promising anticaries agent.

TI  - Generation of Ca2+-independent sortase A mutants with enhanced activity for protein

AB  - Sortase A, a calcium-dependent transpeptidase derived from Staphylococcus aureus, is 
      used in a broad range of applications, such as the conjugation of fluorescent dyes 
      and other moieties to proteins or to the surface of eukaryotic cells. In vivo and 
      cell-based applications of sortase have been somewhat limited by the large range of 
      calcium concentrations, as well as by the often transient nature of protein-protein 
      interactions in living systems. In order to use sortase A for cell labeling 
      applications, we generated a new sortase A variant by combining multiple mutations 
      to yield an enzyme that was both calcium-independent and highly active. This variant 
      has enhanced activity for both N- and C-terminal labeling, as well as for cell 
      surface modification under physiological conditions.

AB  - The bacterial transpeptidase sortase A is a well-established tool in protein 
      chemistry and catalyzes the chemoselective ligation of peptides and proteins. During 
      catalysis sortase A cleaves the conserved Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly sorting motif at the Thr 
      residue under concomitant thioester formation at active site Cys184. We have used 
      expressed protein ligation (EPL) to generate sortase mutants with Cys184 replaced by 
      selenocysteine (Sec) and homocysteine (Hcy). Sec-sortase showed a moderate 2-3-fold 
      reduction in catalytic activity in contrast to Hcy-sortase which is a poor catalyst 
      with less than 1% of wild-type activity. The sensitivity of the active site 
      nucleophiles towards an alkylation reagent correlated with the pKa values of the 
      mutated residues. Furthermore, the pH-profile of Sec-sortase was shifted to more 
      acidic conditions when compared to the wild-type enzyme. These observations provide 
      information on sortase catalysis and the semisynthetic enzymes might represent 
      useful tools for further biochemical investigations and engineering approaches of 
      sortases A.

TI  - Comprehensive characterization of sortase A-dependent surface proteins in 
      Streptococcus mutans.
PG  - 145-156
LID - 10.1111/1348-0421.12958 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, a cariogenic pathogen, adheres to the tooth surface and forms 
      a biofilm. Bacterial cell surface proteins are associated with adherence to 
      substrates. Sortase A (SrtA) mediates the localization of proteins with an LPXTG 
      motif-containing proteins to the cell surface by covalent binding to peptidoglycan. 
      In S. mutans UA159, six SrtA-dependent proteins, SpaP, WapA, WapE, DexA, FruA, and 
      GbpC, were identified. Although some of these proteins were characterized, a 
      comprehensive analysis of the six proteins has not been reported. In this study, we 
      constructed mutants deficient in each of these proteins and the SrtA-deficient 
      mutant. The SrtA-deficient mutant showed drastically decreased binding to salivary 
      components, biofilm formation, bacterial coaggregation activity, hydrophobicity, and 
      cellular matrix binding (collagen type I, fibronectin, and laminin). The 
      SpaP-deficient mutant showed significantly reduced binding to salivary components 
      and partially increased coaggregation with Porphyromonas gingivalis, and decreased 
      hydrophobicity, and collagen binding. The WapA-deficient mutant showed slightly 
      decreased coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum. Although the SrtA-deficient 
      mutant showed drastically altered phenotypes, all SrtA-dependent protein-deficient 
      mutants, except the SpaP-deficient mutant, did not show considerable alterations in 
      binding to salivary components. These results indicate that the six proteins may 
      coordinately contribute to these activities. In addition, using genomic data of 125 
      S. mutans strains, the amino acid sequences of each surface protein were compared 
      and many variations were found among strains, which may affect the phenotype of cell 
      surface proteins in S. mutans.

AB  - Six new bis(indole) alkaloids (1-6) along with eight known ones of the topsentin 
      class were isolated from a Spongosorites sp. sponge of Korea. Based on the results 
      of combined spectroscopic analyses, the structures of spongosoritins A-D (1-4) were 
      determined to possess a 2-methoxy-1-imidazole-5-one core connecting the indole 
      moieties, and these were linked by a linear urea bridge for spongocarbamides A (5) 
      and B (6). The absolute configurations of spongosoritins were assigned by electronic 
      circular dichroism (ECD) computation. The new compounds exhibited moderate 
      inhibition against transpeptidase sortase A and weak inhibition against human 
      pathogenic bacteria and A549 and K562 cancer cell lines.

TI  - Sortase A localizes to distinct foci on the Streptococcus pyogenes membrane.
PG  - 18549-54
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0808301105 [doi]
AB  - Cell wall peptidoglycan-anchored surface proteins are essential virulence factors in 
      many gram-positive bacteria. The attachment of these proteins to the peptidoglycan 
      is achieved through a transpeptidation reaction, whereby sortase cleaves a conserved 
      C-terminal LPXTG motif and covalently attaches the protein to the peptidoglycan 
      precursor lipid II. It is unclear how the sorting reaction is regulated spatially 
      and what part sortase localization plays in determining the distribution of surface 
      proteins. This is mainly the result of inadequate immunofluorescence techniques 
      required to resolve these issues in certain bacterial pathogens. Here we describe 
      the utilization of the phage lysin PlyC to permeabilize the cell wall of 
      Streptococcus pyogenes to antibodies, thereby allowing the localization of sortase A 
      using deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy. We find that sortase localizes 
      within distinct membranal foci, the majority of which are associated with the 
      division septum and colocalize with areas of active M protein anchoring. Sortase 
      distribution to the new septum begins at a very early stage, culminates during 
      septation, and decays after division is completed. This implies that the sorting 
      reaction is a dynamic, highly regulated process, intimately associated with cell 
      division. The ability to study cytoplasmic and membrane antigens using deconvolution 
      immunofluorescence microscopy will facilitate further study of cellular processes in 
      S. pyogenes.

TI  - Sortase A-mediated site-specific labeling of camelid single-domain 
      antibody-fragments: a versatile strategy for multiple molecular imaging modalities.
PG  - 328-339
LID - 10.1002/cmmi.1696 [doi]
AB  - A generic site-specific conjugation method that generates a homogeneous product is 
      of utmost importance in tracer development for molecular imaging and therapy. We 
      explored the protein-ligation capacity of the enzyme Sortase A to label camelid 
      single-domain antibody-fragments, also known as nanobodies. The versatility of the 
      approach was demonstrated by conjugating independently three different imaging 
      probes: the chelating agents CHX-A"-DTPA and NOTA for single-photon emission 
      computed tomography (SPECT) with indium-111 and positron emission tomography (PET) 
      with gallium-68, respectively, and the fluorescent dye Cy5 for fluorescence 
      reflectance imaging (FRI). After a straightforward purification process, homogeneous 
      single-conjugated tracer populations were obtained in high yield (30-50%). The 
      enzymatic conjugation did not affect the affinity of the tracers, nor the 
      radiolabeling efficiency or spectral characteristics. In vivo, the tracers enabled 
      the visualization of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressing 
      BT474M1-tumors with high contrast and specificity as soon as 1 h post injection in 
      all three imaging modalities. These data demonstrate Sortase A-mediated conjugation 
      as a valuable strategy for the development of site-specifically labeled camelid 
      single-domain antibody-fragments for use in multiple molecular imaging modalities.

AB  - Chitosan macro-particles prepared by the neutralization method were applied to 
      Sortase A (SrtA) immobilization using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinking agent. The 
      particles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed 
      to optimize the immobilization process. An average specific activity of 3142 U (mg 
      protein)(-1) was obtained under optimized immobilization conditions (chitosan 
      concentration 3%, SrtA concentration 0.5 mg·mL(-1), glutaraldehyde concentration 
      0.5%, crosslinking and immobilization at 20 °C, crosslinking for 3 h, and an 
      immobilization time of 8 h). The transpeptidase activity of immobilized SrtA was 
      proved by a peptide-to-peptide ligation with a conversion yield approximately at 
      80%, and the immobilized catalyst was successfully reused for five cycles without 
      obvious activity loss. Moreover, the scale-up capability of using immobilized SrtA 
      to catalyze a head-to-tail peptide cyclization was investigated in a batch reaction 
      and the conversion yield was more than 95% when using 20 mg of peptide as a 
      substrate.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA), a type of transpeptidase responsible for anchoring surface 
      proteins to the peptidoglycan cell wall, is important in the virulence of 
      gram-positive bacteria. Three compounds were isolated from marine-derived 
      Streptomyces sp. MBTH32 using various chromatography techniques. The structures of 
      these compounds were determined based on spectroscopic data and comparisons with 
      previously reported data. Among the metabolites tested, lumichrome showed strong 
      inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus SrtA without affecting cell 
      viability. The results of cell clumping activity assessment suggest the potential 
      for using this compound to treat S. aureus infection by inhibiting SrtA activity.

AB  - The enzyme sortase A is a ligase which catalyzes transpeptidation reactions.1, 2 
      Surface proteins, including virulence factors, that have a C terminal recognition 
      sequence are attached to Gly5 on the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls by 
      sortase A.1 The enzyme is an important anti-virulence and anti-infective drug target 
      for resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria.2 In addition, because sortase A 
      enables the splicing of polypeptide chains, the transpeptidation reaction catalyzed 
      by sortase A is a potentially valuable tool for protein science.3 Here we describe 
      the total chemical synthesis of enzymatically active sortase A. The target 148 
      residue polypeptide chain of sortase AΔN59 was synthesized by the convergent 
      chemical ligation of four unprotected synthetic peptide segments. The folded protein 
      molecule was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography and had full enzymatic 
      activity in a transpeptidation assay. Total synthesis of sortase A will enable more 
      sophisticated engineering of this important enzyme molecule.

TI  - Discovery of a New Class of Sortase A Transpeptidase Inhibitors to Tackle

      Derivatives.

AB  - A FRET-based random screening assay was used to generate hit compounds as sortase A 
      inhibitors that allowed us to identify ethyl 
      3-oxo-2-(2-phenylhydrazinylidene)butanoate as an example of a new class of sortase A 
      inhibitors. Other analogues were generated by changing the ethoxycarbonyl function 
      for a carboxy, cyano or amide group, or introducing substituents in the phenyl ring 
      of the ester and acid derivatives. The most active derivative found was 
      3-oxo-2-(2-(3,4dichlorophenyl)hydrazinylidene)butanoic acid (2b), showing an IC50 
      value of 50 µM. For a preliminary assessment of their antivirulence properties the 
      new derivatives were tested for their antibiofilm activity. The most active compound 
      resulted 2a, which showed inhibition of about 60% against S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. 
      aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 6538 and S. epidermidis RP62A at a screening 
      concentration of 100 µM.

TI  - C-Terminal-oriented Immobilization of Enzymes Using Sortase A-mediated Technique.
PG  - 1375-80
LID - 10.1002/mabi.201500113 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, sortase A-mediated immobilization of enzymes was used for the 
      preparation of immobilized enzymes. Thermobifida fusca YX β-glucosidase (BGL) or 
      Streptococcus bovis 148 α-amylase (AmyA) were produced with C-terminal sortase A 
      recognition sequences. The resulting fusion proteins were successfully immobilized 
      on nanoparticle surfaces using sortase A. Some properties (activity, stability, and 
      reusability) of the immobilized fusion proteins were evaluated. Both immobilized BGL 
      and immobilized AmyA prepared by the sortase A-mediated technique retained their 
      catalytic activity, exhibiting activities 3.0- or 1.5-fold (respectively) of those 
      seen with the same enzymes immobilized by chemical crosslinking. Immobilized enzymes 
      prepared by the sortase A-mediated technique did not undergo dramatic changes in 
      stability compared with the respective free enzymes. Thus, the sortase A-mediated 
      technique provides a promising method for immobilization of active, stable enzymes.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) anchors surface proteins to the cell wall and aids biofilm 
      formation during infection, which functions as a key virulence factor of important 
      Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. At present researchers need 
      a way in which to validate whether or not SrtA is a druggable target alternative to 
      the conventional antibiotic targets in the mechanism. In this study, we performed a 
      high-throughput screening and identified a new class of potential inhibitors of S. 
      aureus SrtA, which are derived from natural products and contain the quinone 
      skeleton. Compound 283 functions as an irreversible inhibitor that covalently 
      alkylates the active site Cys184 of SrtA. NMR analysis confirms the direct 
      interaction of the small-molecule inhibitor towards SrtA protein. The anchoring of 
      protein A (SpA) to the cell wall and the biofilm formation are significantly 
      attenuated when the S. aureus Newman strain is cultured in the presence of 
      inhibitor. Our study indicates that compound 283 could be a potential hit for the 
      development of new anti-virulence agents against S. aureus infections by covalently 
      targeting SrtA.

AB  - The functionalization of proteins with different cargo molecules is highly desirable 
      for a broad range of applications. However, the reproducible production of defined 
      conjugates with multiple functionalities is a significant challenge. Herein, we 
      report the dual site-specific labeling of an antibody fragment, utilizing the 
      orthogonal Sortase A and π-clamp conjugation methods, and demonstrate that binding 
      of the antibody fragment to its target receptor is retained after dual labeling.

AB  - To date, multi-drug resistant bacteria represent an increasing health threat, with a 
      high impact on mortality, morbidity, and health costs on a global scale. The ability 
      of bacteria to rapidly and permanently acquire new virulence factors and 
      drug-resistance elements requires the development of new antimicrobial agents and 
      selection of new proper targets, such as sortase A. This specific bacterial target 
      plays an important role in the virulence of many Gram-positive pathogens, and its 
      inhibition should produce a mild evolutionary pressure which will not favor the 
      development of resistance. A primary screening using a fluorescence resonance energy 
      transfer assay was used to experimentally evaluate the inhibitory activity of 
      several compounds on sortase A. Using molecular docking and structure-activity 
      relationship analyses, several lead inhibitors were identified, which were further 
      tested for antimicrobial activity using the well diffusion test and minimum 
      inhibitory concentration. The toxicity was assessed using the Daphnia magna test and 
      used as a future screening filter. Three natural compounds were identified in this 
      study as promising candidates for further development into therapeutically useful 
      anti-infective agents that could be used to treat infections caused by multi-drug 
      resistant bacterial pathogens which include sortase A in their enzymatic set.

AB  - In this work we explored an enzyme-mediated method for selective and efficient 
      decoration of aqueous microgels with biomolecules. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (VCL) 
      microgels with varied amounts of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) as comonomer 
      incorporated in the microgel shell were synthesized and characterized in regard to 
      their size, swelling degree, and temperature-responsiveness in aqueous solutions. 
      The surface of the PVCL/GMA microgel containing 5 mol % glycidyl methyacrylate was 
      modified by grafting of a specific recognition peptide sequence (LPETG) for Sortase 
      A from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa-SrtA(Δ59)). Sortase-mediated conjugation of the 
      enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) carrying a N-terminal triglycine tag to 
      LPETG-modified microgels was successfully performed. Conjugation of eGFP to the 
      microgel surface was qualitatively proven by confocal microscopy and by fluorescence 
      intensity measurements. The developed protocol enables a precise control of the 
      amount of eGFP grafted to the microgel surface as evidenced by the linear increase 
      of fluorescence intensity of modified microgel samples. The kinetic of the 
      sortase-mediated coupling reaction was determined by time-dependent fluorescence 
      intensity measurements. In summary, sortase-mediated coupling reactions are a simple 
      and powerful technique for targeted surface functionalization of stimuli-responsive 
      microgels with biomolecules.

TI  - A peptide-based coating toolbox to enable click chemistry on polymers, metals, and 
      silicon through sortagging.
PG  - 1520-1530
LID - 10.1002/bit.27666 [doi]
AB  - A versatile peptide-based toolbox for surface functionalization was established by a 
      combination of a universal material binding peptide (LCI-anchor peptide) and 
      sortase-mediated bioconjugation (sortagging). This toolbox facilitates surface 
      functionalization either as a one- or a two-step strategy. In the case of the 
      one-step strategy, the desired functionality was directly introduced to LCI. For the 
      two-step strategy, LCI was modified with a reactive group, which can be further 
      functionalized (e.g., employing "click" chemistry). Sortagging of LCI, employing 
      sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus, was achieved with six different amine 
      compounds: dibenzocyclooctyne amine, biotin-polyethylene glycol amine, Cyanine-3 
      amine, kanamycin, methoxypolyethylene glycol amine (Mn = 5000 Da), and 
      2,2,3,3,4,4,4-Heptafluorobutylamine. The purification of LCI-amine sortagging 
      products was performed by a negative purification using Strep-tag II affinity 
      chromatography, resulting in LCI-amine conjugates with purities >90%. For the 
      two-step strategy, the LCI-dibenzocyclooctyne sortagging product was purified and 
      enabled, through copper-free azide-alkyne "click" chemistry, universal surface 
      functionalization of material surfaces such as polypropylene, polyethylene 
      terephthalate, stainless steel, gold, and silicon. The click reaction was performed 
      before or after surface binding of LCI-dibenzocyclooctyne. Finally, in the case of 
      the one-step strategy, polypropylene was directly functionalized with Cyanine-3 and 
      biotin-polyethylene glycol amine.

TI  - Molecular Modelling reveals the inhibition mechanism and structure-activity 
      relationship of curcumin and its analogues to Staphylococcal aureus Sortase A.
PG  - 1220-1230
LID - 10.1080/07391102.2018.1453380 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies found that the activity of Sortase A, a bacterial surface protein 
      from Staphylococcus aureus, was inhibited by curcumin and its analogues. To explore 
      this inhibitory mechanism, Sortase A and its inhibitors in complex systems were 
      studied by molecular docking, molecular modelling, binding energy decomposition 
      calculation and steered molecular dynamics simulations. Energy decomposition 
      analysis indicated that PRO-163, LEU-169, GLN-172, ILE-182 and ILE-199 are key 
      residues in Sortase A-inhibitor complexes. Furthermore, interactions between the 
      methoxyl group on the benzene ring in the conjugated molecule (curcumin, 
      demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin) and VAL-168, LEU-169 and GLN-172 induce the 
      inhibitory activity based on the energy decomposition and distance analyses between 
      the whole residues and inhibitors. However, because of its coiled structure, the 
      non-conjugated molecule, tetrahydrocurcumin, with key residues in the binding sites 
      of Sortase A, interacted weakly with SrtA, leading to the loss of inhibitory 
      activity. Based on these results, the methoxyl group on the benzene ring in the 
      conjugated molecule largely influenced the inhibitory activity of the Sortase A 
      inhibitors.

AB  - To study the antimicrobial effects of quaternary ammonium silane (QAS) exposure on 
      Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus bacterial biofilms at different 
      concentrations. Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus biofilms were 
      cultured on dentine disks, and incubated for bacterial adhesion for 3-days. Disks 
      were treated with disinfectant (experimental QAS or control) and returned to culture 
      for four days. Small-molecule drug discovery-suite was used to analyze QAS/Sortase-A 
      active site. Cleavage of a synthetic fluorescent peptide substrate, was used to 
      analyze inhibition of Sortase-A. Raman spectroscopy was performed and biofilms 
      stained for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Dentine disks that contained 
      treated dual-species biofilms were examined using scanning electron microscopy 
      (SEM). Analysis of DAPI within biofilms was performed using CLSM. Fatty acids in 
      bacterial membranes were assessed with succinic-dehydrogenase assay along with 
      time-kill assay. Sortase-A protein underwent conformational change due to QAS 
      molecule during simulation, showing fluctuating alpha and beta strands. Spectroscopy 
      revealed low carbohydrate intensities in 1% and 2% QAS. SEM images demonstrated 
      absence of bacterial colonies after treatment. DAPI staining decreased with 1% QAS 
      (p < 0.05). Fatty acid compositions of dual specie biofilm increased in both 1% and 
      2% QAS specimens (p < 0.05). Quaternary ammonium silane demonstrated to be a potent 
      antibacterial cavity disinfectant and a plaque inhibitor and can be of potential 
      significance in eliminating caries-forming bacteria.

TI  - Irreversible sortase A-mediated ligation driven by diketopiperazine formation.
PG  - 487-92
LID - 10.1021/jo4024914 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA)-mediated ligation has emerged as an attractive tool in bioorganic 
      chemistry attributing to the remarkable specificity of the ligation reaction and the 
      physiological reaction conditions. However, the reversible nature of this reaction 
      limits the efficiency of the ligation reaction and has become a significant 
      constraint to its more widespread use. We report herein a novel set of SrtA 
      substrates (LPETGG-isoacyl-Ser and LPETGG-isoacyl-Hse) that can be irreversibly 
      ligated to N-terminal Gly-containing moieties via the deactivation of the 
      SrtA-excised peptide fragment through diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. The 
      convenience of the synthetic procedure and the stability of the substrates in the 
      ligation buffer suggest that both LPETGG-isoacyl-Ser and LPETGG-isoacyl-Hse are 
      valuable alternatives to existing irreversible SrtA substrate sequences.

TI  - Chalcone Attenuates Staphylococcus aureus Virulence by Targeting Sortase A and 
      Alpha-Hemolysin.
PG  - 1715
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2017.01715 [doi]
LID - 1715
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) resistance, considered a dilemma for the clinical 
      treatment of this bacterial infection, is becoming increasingly intractable. Novel 
      anti-virulence strategies will undoubtedly provide a path forward in combating these 
      resistant bacterial infections. Sortase A (SrtA), an enzyme responsible for 
      anchoring virulence-related surface proteins, and alpha-hemolysin (Hla), a 
      pore-forming cytotoxin, have aroused great scientific interest, as they have been 
      regarded as targets for promising agents against S. aureus infection. In this study, 
      we discovered that chalcone, a natural small compound with little anti-S. aureus 
      activity, could significantly inhibit SrtA activity with an IC(50) of 53.15 μM and 
      Hla hemolysis activity with an IC(50) of 17.63 μM using a fluorescence resonance 
      energy transfer (FRET) assay and a hemolysis assay, respectively. In addition, 
      chalcone was proven to reduce protein A (SpA) display in intact bacteria, binding to 
      fibronectin, formation of biofilm and S. aureus invasion. Chalcone could 
      down-regulate the transcriptional levels of the hla gene and the agrA gene, thus 
      leading to a reduction in the expression of Hla and significant protection against 
      Hla-mediated A549 cell injury; more importantly, chalcone could also reduce 
      mortality in infected mice. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations and 
      mutagenesis assays were used to identify the mechanism of chalcone against SrtA, 
      which implied that the inhibitory activity lies in the bond between chalcone and 
      SrtA residues Val168, Ile182, and Arg197. Taken together, the in vivo and in vitro 
      experiments suggest that chalcone is a potential novel therapeutic compound for S. 
      aureus infection via targeting SrtA and Hla.

TI  - Sortase A-mediated synthesis of ligand-grafted cyclized peptides for modulating a 
      model protein-protein interaction.
PG  - 1499-505
LID - 10.1002/biot.201500013 [doi]
AB  - Specific ligand-grafted cyclic peptides are promising drug candidates that can 
      modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with increased proteolytic stability. 
      In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that Sortase A (SrtA)-mediated peptide 
      transpeptidation can be applied to produce bioactive sequence-grafted, stable, 
      cyclic peptides. A naturally occurring cyclic peptide, sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 
      (SFTI-1), was selected as the scaffold, and a tetrapeptide motif, Glu-Ser-Asp-Val 
      (ESDV), was grafted into the scaffold as a model ligand. The linear precursor of the 
      grafted peptide with SrtA-recognition motifs at the N- and C-termini was cyclized in 
      good yield simply by co-incubation with SrtA. The ESDV-grafted cyclic SFTI-1 
      obtained was confirmed to have high stability against proteolysis by human serum and 
      bound to the target PDZ2 domain of postsynaptic density-95 protein. An optimized 
      sequence-grafted cyclic SFTI-1 could competitively suppress the interaction of PDZ2 
      with its natural ligand, the C-terminal peptide of the NR2B subunit of the 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. These results show that a strategy combining peptide 
      grafting into the SFTI-1 scaffold with SrtA-catalyzed cyclization can be a simple 
      and effective method for producing stable peptide drugs.

TI  - Identification of potential inhibitors of sortase A: Binding studies, in-silico

      faecalis.

AB  - Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) is a Gram positive multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterium 
      contributing about 70% of total enterococcal infections. In Ef, a membrane anchored 
      transpeptidase Sortase A plays a major role in biofilm formation. Therefore, it has 
      been recognized as an ideal drug target against Ef. In this regard to identify the 
      potential inhibitors of Ef Sortase A (EfSrtA(∆59)), we have cloned, expressed and 
      purified EfSrtA(∆59). We have also done the in-silico docking studies to identify 
      lead molecules interacting with EfSrtA(∆59). Furthermore, the binding studies of 
      these identified lead molecules were performed with EfSrtA(∆59) using fluorescence 
      and CD spectroscopic studies. We also identified the interaction partner of 
      EfSrtA(∆59) using STRING. Protein-protein docking studies were also performed. 
      Docking experiment revealed that benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, pantoprazole and 
      valsartan were bound to same site on the protein with similar interactions. Binding 
      studies using fluorescence spectroscopic studies confirmed the binding of all the 
      ligands to EfSrtA(∆59), which was further validated by far and near-UV CD 
      experiments. Thermo stability experiments validate the stability-activity trade-off 
      hypothesis. Sequence based interaction studies identified that EfSrtA(∆59) interact 
      with the Ef_1091, Ef_1093 and Ef_2658 proteins. Homology model of Ef_1091 and 
      Ef_1093 was docked with modeled EfSrtA(∆59) and their interactions are also 
      discussed.

TI  - Crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A: implications for sortase 
      mechanism.
PG  - 6924-33

AB  - Sortases are a family of Gram-positive bacterial transpeptidases that anchor 
      secreted proteins to bacterial cell surfaces. These include many proteins that play 
      critical roles in the virulence of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens such that 
      sortases are attractive targets for development of novel antimicrobial agents. All 
      Gram-positive pathogens express a "housekeeping" sortase that recognizes the 
      majority of secreted proteins containing an LPXTG wall-sorting motif and covalently 
      attaches these to bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Many Gram-positive pathogens 
      also express additional sortases that link a small number of proteins, often with 
      variant wall-sorting motifs, to either other surface proteins or peptidoglycan. To 
      better understand the mechanisms of catalysis and substrate recognition by the 
      housekeeping sortase produced by the important human pathogen Streptococcus 
      pyogenes, the crystal structure of this protein has been solved and its 
      transpeptidase activity established in vitro. The structure reveals a novel 
      arrangement of key catalytic residues in the active site of a sortase, the first 
      that is consistent with kinetic analysis. The structure also provides a complete 
      description of residue positions surrounding the active site, overcoming the 
      limitation of localized disorder in previous structures of sortase A-type proteins. 
      Modification of the active site Cys through oxidation to its sulfenic acid form or 
      by an alkylating reagent supports a role for a reactive thiol/thiolate in the 
      catalytic mechanism. These new insights into sortase structure and function could 
      have important consequences for inhibitor design.

TI  - Directed evolution of sortase A mutants with altered substrate selectivity profiles.
PG  - 17536-9
LID - 10.1021/ja205630g [doi]
AB  - The ligation of two polypeptides in a chemoselective manner by the bacterial 
      transpeptidase sortase A has become a versatile tool for protein engineering 
      approaches. When sortase-mediated ligation is used for protein semisynthesis, up to 
      four mutations resulting from the strict requirement of the LPxTG sorting motif are 
      introduced into the target protein. Here we report the directed evolution of a 
      mutant sortase A that possesses broad substrate selectivity. A phage-display screen 
      of a mutant sortase library that was randomized in the substrate recognition loop 
      was used to isolate this mutant. The altered substrate selectivity represents a 
      gain-of-function that was exploited for the traceless semisynthesis of histone H3. 
      Our report is a decisive step toward a platform of engineered sortases with distinct 
      ligation properties that will conceivably allow for more versatile assemblies of 
      modified proteins in biotechnological approaches.

AB  - High-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries has led to the identification 
      of thiadiazoles as a new class of inhibitors against Staphylococcus aureus sortase A 
      (SrtA). N-(5-((4-nitrobenzyl)thio)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)nicotinamide 
      (IC(50) = 3.8 µM) was identified as a potent inhibitor of SrtA after synthetic 
      modification of hit compounds. Additional ligands developed in this study displayed 
      affinities in the low micromolar range without affecting bacterial growth in vitro. 
      The study also suggest a new mode of action through covalent binding to the active 
      site cysteine.

TI  - Streptococcus suis sortase A is Ca2+ independent and is inhibited by acteoside,

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) has long been recognized as an ideal drug target for therapeutic 
      agents against Gram-positive pathogens. However, the SrtA of Streptococcus suis 
      (Ss-SrtA), an important zoonotic agent, has not been studied. In this study, the 
      enzymatic properties of Ss-SrtA were investigated, and inhibition of Ss-SrtA by 
      natural products was evaluated. Ss-SrtA was expressed and purified. The purified 
      recombinant Ss-SrtA had maximal activity at pH 6.0-7.5, 45°C, and showed a Km of 6.7 
      μM for the hydrolysis of substrate abz-LPATG-dnp. Different from Staphylococcus 
      aureus SrtA (Sa-SrtA) which is stimulated by Ca2+, Ss-SrtA was observed to be Ca2+ 
      independent. Structural analysis showed that salt bridges formed between K111 and 
      D180 in Ss-SrtA replaced the function of Ca2+ in Sa-SrtA to stabilize the 
      substrate-binding cleft. Site-directed mutagenesis identified H126, C192 and R200 as 
      the key residues of Ss-SrtA active site. To discover potential inhibitors, the 
      percent inhibition of sortase activity by natural products was measured. Among these 
      selected natural products, acteoside, isoquercitrin and baicalin were discovered as 
      novel SrtA inhibitors, with IC50 values of 36.3 ± 1.3 μM, 100.0 ± 1.3 μM and 85.4 ± 
      1.5 μM, respectively. The inhibitory effects of these three natural products were 
      further confirmed on endogenous Sa-SrtA. Using a previously established S. aureus 
      model with a fluorescent-labeled Sa-SrtA substrate, acteoside, isoquercitrin, and 
      baicalin showed 86%, 28% and 45% inhibition on endogenous Sa-SrtA activity, 
      respectively. Overall, these findings shed new light on enzymatic properties, 
      Ca2+-independent catalytic mechanism and potential inhibitors of Ss-SrtA.

TI  - Quercetin impairs Streptococcus pneumoniae biofilm formation by inhibiting sortase A 
      activity.
PG  - 6228-6237
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13910 [doi]
AB  - Biofilm formation mediated by sortase A (srtA) is important for bacterial 
      colonisation and resistance to antibiotics. Thus, the inhibitor of SrtA may 
      represent a promising agent for bacterial infection. The structure of Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae D39 srtA has been characterised by crystallisation. Site-directed 
      mutagenesis was used for the determination of the key residues for the activity of 
      S. pneumoniae D39 srtA. An effective srtA inhibitor, quercetin, and its mechanism 
      was further identified using srtA activity inhibition assay and molecular modelling. 
      In this study, the crystal structure of S. pneumoniae D39 srtA has been solved and 
      shown to contain a unique domain B. Additionally, its transpeptidase activity was 
      evaluated in vitro. Based on the structure, we identified Cys207 as the catalytic 
      residue, with His141 and Arg215 serving as binding sites for the peptide substrate. 
      We found that quercetin can specifically compete with the natural substrate, leading 
      to a significant decrease in the catalytic activity of this enzyme. In cells 
      co-cultured with this small molecule inhibitor, NanA cannot anchor to the cell wall 
      effectively, and biofilm formation and biomass decrease significantly. 
      Interestingly, when we supplemented cultures with sialic acid, a crucial signal for 
      pneumococcal coloniation and the invasion of the host in the co-culture system, 
      biofilm loss did not occur. This result indicates that quercetin inhibits biofilm 
      formation by affecting sialic acid production. In conclusion, the inhibition of 
      pneumococcal srtA by the small molecule quercetin offers a novel strategy for 
      pneumococcal preventative therapy.

TI  - Construction of a Streptococcus iniae sortase A mutant and evaluation of its 
      potential as an attenuated modified live vaccine in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis 
      niloticus).

AB  - Streptococcus iniae is a major Gram-positive aquatic pathogen, which causes invasive 
      diseases in cultured fish worldwide. The identification of potential virulence 
      determinants of streptococcal infections will help to understand and control this 
      disease, but only a few have been confirmed in S. iniae. Sortase A (srtA) is the key 
      enzyme that anchors pre-mature cell wall-attached proteins to peptidoglycan and it 
      can affect the correct positioning of surface proteins, as well as the course of 
      Gram-positive bacterial infection, thereby making it a potential target in the study 
      of virulence factors and disease control. In this study, the 759 bp srtA gene was 
      cloned from pathogenic S. iniae TBY-1 strain and the mutant strain TBY-1ΔsrtA was 
      constructed via allelic exchange mutagenesis. We found that srtA shares high 
      similarities with sortase A from other Streptococcus spp. Direct survival rate assay 
      and challenge experiments were performed, which showed that the mutant strain 
      TBY-1ΔsrtA had a lower survival capacity in healthy tilapia blood and it was less 
      virulent than the wild type strain in tilapia, thereby indicating that the deletion 
      of sortase A affects the virulence and infectious capacity of S. iniae. The mutant 
      strain TBY-1ΔsrtA was used as a live vaccine, which was administered via 
      intraperitoneal injection, and it provided the relative percent survival value of 
      95.5% in Nile tilapia, thereby demonstrating its high potential as an effective 
      attenuated live vaccine candidate.

TI  - Backbone cyclization of a recombinant cystine-knot peptide by engineered Sortase A.
PG  - 4487-96
AB  - Cyclotides belong to the family of cyclic cystine-knot peptides and have shown 
      promise as scaffolds for protein engineering and pharmacological modulation of 
      cellular protein activity. Cyclotides are characterized by a cystine-knotted 
      topology and a head-to-tail cyclic polypeptide backbone. While they are primarily 
      produced in plants, cyclotides have also been obtained by chemical synthesis. 
      However, there is still a need for methods to generate cyclotides in high yields to 
      near homogeneity. Here, we report a biomimetic approach which utilizes an engineered 
      version of the enzyme Sortase A to catalyze amide backbone cyclization of the 
      recombinant cyclotide MCoTI-II, thereby allowing the efficient production of active 
      homogenous species in high yields. Our results provide proof of concept for using 
      engineered Sortase A to produce cyclic MCoTI-II and should be generally applicable 
      to generating other cyclic cystine-knot peptides.

AB  - Proteomics approaches using MS in combination with affinity purification have 
      emerged as powerful tools to study protein-protein interactions. Here we make use of 
      the specificity of sortase A transpeptidation reaction to prepare affinity matrices 
      in which a protein bait is covalently linked to the matrix via a short C-terminal 
      linker region. As a result of this site-directed immobilization, the bait remains 
      functionally accessible to protein interactions. To apply this approach, we 
      performed SILAC-based pull-down experiments and demonstrate the suitability of the 
      approach.

      Highly Efficient Cargo Loading.
PG  - 2429-34
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00485 [doi]
AB  - A new strategy is described for the modification of CCMV for loading of cargoes 
      inside the viral capsid. Sortase A, an enzyme which is present in Gram-positive 
      bacteria, was used to attach cargo to the glycine-tagged N-termini of several CCMV 
      variants. We show that small molecules and proteins bearing a C-terminal LPETG-motif 
      can be attached in this way. This method allows for the site-specific, covalent, and 
      orthogonal modification of CCMV capsids in a mild fashion, leading to high 
      encapsulation efficiencies. This strategy can easily be expanded to other types of 
      cargoes, labeled with an LPETG-tag without altering protein function.

PG  - 3588-3599
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b00434 [doi]
AB  - Targeted therapies are rapidly evolving modalities of cancer treatment. The largest 
      group of currently developed biopharmaceuticals is antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). 
      Here, we developed a new modular strategy for the generation of cytotoxic 
      bioconjugates, containing a homodimer of targeting protein and two highly potent 
      anticancer drugs with distinct mechanisms of action. Instead of antibody, we applied 
      human fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) as a targeting protein. We produced a 
      conjugate of FGF2 with either monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or α-amanitin (αAMTN) 
      as a cytotoxic agent and subsequently applied a sortase A-mediated ligation to 
      obtain a dimeric conjugate containing both MMAE and αAMTN. The developed method 
      ensures site-specific conjugation and a controlled drug-to-protein ratio. We 
      validated our approach by demonstrating that dimeric dual warhead conjugate exhibits 
      higher cytotoxic potency against fibroblast growth factor receptor-positive cell 
      lines than single-warhead conjugates. Our modular technology can be applied to other 
      targeting proteins or drugs and thus can be used for preparation of different 
      bioconjugates.

AB  - Group A streptococci (GAS) are associated with a variety of mucosal and invasive 
      human infections. Recurrent infections by highly heterologous serotypes indicate 
      that cross-serotype immunity is critical for prevention of GAS infections; however, 
      mechanisms underlying serotype-independent protection are poorly understood. Here we 
      report that intranasal vaccination of mice with Sortase A (SrtA), a conserved cell 
      wall bound protein, reduced colonization of nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) 
      by heterologous serotypes of GAS. Vaccination significantly increased CD4+ IL-17A+ 
      cells in NALT and depletion of IL-17A by neutralizing antibody prevented GAS 
      clearance from NALT which was dependent on immunization with SrtA. Vaccination also 
      induced high levels of SrtA-specific antibodies; however, immunized, B 
      cell-deficient mice cleared streptococcal challenges as efficiently as wild type 
      mice, indicating that the cross-serotype protection is Th17-biased and 
      antibody-independent. Furthermore, efficient GAS clearance from NALT was associated 
      with a rapid neutrophil influx into NALT of immunized mice. These results suggest 
      that serotype independent immune protection against GAS mucosal infection can be 
      achieved by intranasal vaccination with SrtA and enhanced neutrophil function is 
      critical for anti-GAS defense and might be a target for prevention of GAS 
      infections.

AB  - Lactococcus lactis IL1403 harbors a putative sortase A (SrtA) and 11 putative 
      sortase substrates that carry the canonical LPXTG signature of such substrates. We 
      report here on the functionality of SrtA to anchor five LPXTG substrates to the cell 
      wall, thus suggesting that SrtA is the housekeeping sortase in L. lactis IL1403.

AB  - Lipid nanodiscs have broad applications in membrane protein assays, biotechnology 
      and materials science. Chemical modification of the nanodiscs to expand their 
      functional attributes is generally desirable for all of these uses. We present a 
      method for site-selective labelling of the N-terminus of the nanodisc's membrane 
      scaffold protein (MSP) using the Sortase A protein. Labelling of the MSP was 
      achieved when assembled within the lipid nanodisc architecture, demonstrating that 
      this method can be used as a retrofit approach to modification of preformed 
      nanodiscs before or during application. We label the MSP with a fluorescent 
      fluorescein moiety and use them to image nanodisc uptake into HeLa cells. The 
      Sortase A labelling method could be employed as a general approach to labelling 
      nanodiscs with application-specific functionalities.

      (PBSL).

AB  - S. aureus sortase A (SrtA), a calcium-dependent bacterial transpeptidase, is 
      commonly used to site-specifically label proteins containing a LPXTG SrtA 
      recognition motif with a wide array of chemical moieties. A major limitation of 
      sortase-mediated labeling, however, is SrtA's poor binding affinity to its 
      recognition motif, resulting in long reaction times and poor ligation efficiencies. 
      Here we describe proximity-based sortase-mediated ligation (PBSL), which utilizes 
      the SpyTag-SpyCatcher peptide-protein pair to tether target proteins with a SrtA 
      recognition motif to SrtA, dramatically increasing their local concentrations and 
      overcoming this limitation.

LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03562 [doi]
AB  - The identification and quantification of low-abundant proteins are always impeded by 
      high-abundant proteins in proteomic analysis because of the extreme complexity of 
      peptide mixtures and wide dynamic range of protein abundances. Here, we developed a 
      novel approach to enrich and quantify N-terminal glycine peptides through sortase A 
      mediated ligation. This strategy was based on the formation of a covalent bond 
      between the sortase A recognition motif LPXTG and a N-terminal glycine residue. 
      Also, the quantification was achieved by introducing isotopically labeled threonine 
      in the motif LPXTG. In this strategy, both the enrichment of N-terminal glycine 
      peptides and the stable isotope labeling were achieved in a single step. We applied 
      this approach for the proteome analysis of MCF-7 cell line. It was demonstrated a 
      significant reduction in sample complexity via highly selective and efficient 
      enrichment of N-terminal glycine peptides, thereby detecting lots of less abundant 
      proteins and enhancing proteome coverage. In comparison to the untreated sample, an 
      increase of 34% of proteins was additionally identified. Furthermore, 97% of 
      proteins were successfully quantified with high accuracy. In summary, this 
      quantitative N-terminal glycine peptides enrichment strategy is expected for 
      high-throughput qualitative and quantitative proteomic analysis as a complementary 
      approach to conventional shotgun proteomics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the major aetiological agent of 
      dental caries, and the transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA) plays a major role in 
      cariogenicity. The T168G and G470A missense mutations in the srtA gene may be linked 
      to caries susceptibility, as demonstrated in our previous studies. This study aimed 
      to investigate the effects of these missense mutations of the srtA gene on SrtA 
      enzyme activity in S. mutans. METHODS: The point mutated recombinant S.mutans T168G 
      and G470A sortases were expressed in expression plasmid pET32a. S. mutans UA159 
      sortase coding gene srtA was used as the template for point mutation. Enzymatic 
      activity was assessed by quantifying increases in the fluorescence intensity 
      generated when a substrate Dabcyl-QALPNTGEE-Edans was cleaved by SrtA. The kinetic 
      constants were calculated based on the curve fit for the Michaelis-Menten equation. 
      RESULTS: SrtA△N40(UA159) and the mutant enzymes, SrtA△N40(D56E) and SrtA△N40(R157H), 
      were expressed and purified. A kinetic analysis showed that the affinity of 
      SrtA△N40(D56E) and SrtA△N40(R157H) remained approximately equal to the affinity of 
      SrtA△N40(UA159), as determined by the Michaelis constant (K m ). However, the 
      catalytic rate constant (k cat ) and catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) of 
      SrtA△N40(D56E) were reduced compared with those of SrtA△N40(R157H) and 
      SrtA△N40(UA159), whereas the k cat and k cat /K m values of SrtA△N40(R157H) were 
      slightly lower than those of SrtA△N40(UA159). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this 
      study indicate that the T168G missense mutation of the srtA gene results in a 
      significant reduction in enzymatic activity compared with S. mutans UA159, 
      suggesting that the T168G missense mutation of the srtA gene may be related to low 
      cariogenicity.

AB  - In order to achieve efficient extracellular expression of Sortase A (SrtA), various 
      strategies in Pichia pastoris system were applied in this study. Among different 
      constructed recombinant strains, the SMD1168 strain integrated 5.7 copies of srtA 
      gene under control of AOX1 promoter was proved to be the best strain for the 
      extracellular SrtA expression. After the optimization of fermentation conditions 
      (induction 72 h at 28 °C, initial pH 6.0, supplemented with 1.5% methanol), the 
      highest yield and activity of extracellular SrtA reached 97.8 mg/L and 131.9 U/mL at 
      the shake-flask level, respectively. This is the first report on the efficient 
      secretory expression of SrtA in P. pastoris and the yield of SrtA is the maximum 
      compared with previous reports. In addition, the transpeptidation activity of 
      extracellular SrtA was confirmed by the successful immobilization of enhanced green 
      fluorescent protein (EGFP) onto Gly(3)-polystyrene beads.

TI  - A versatile papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) vaccine platform based on sortase-mediated 
      antigen coupling.
PG  - 54

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flexuous rod-shaped nanoparticles made of the coat protein (CP) of 
      papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) have been shown to trigger innate immunity through 
      engagement of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). PapMV nanoparticles can also serve as a 
      vaccine platform as they can increase the immune response to fused peptide antigens. 
      Although this approach shows great potential, fusion of antigens directly to the CP 
      open reading frame (ORF) is challenging because the fused peptides can alter the 
      structure of the CP and its capacity to self assemble into nanoparticles-a property 
      essential for triggering an efficient immune response to the peptide. This 
      represents a serious limitation to the utility of this approach as fusion of small 
      peptides only is tolerated. RESULTS: We have developed a novel approach in which 
      peptides are fused directly to pre-formed PapMV nanoparticles. This approach is 
      based on the use of a bacterial transpeptidase (sortase A; SrtA) that can attach the 
      peptide directly to the nanoparticle. An engineered PapMV CP harbouring the SrtA 
      recognition motif allows efficient coupling. To refine our engineering, and to 
      predict the efficacy of coupling with SrtA, we modeled the PapMV structure based on 
      the known structure of PapMV CP and on recent reports revealing the structure of two 
      closely related potexviruses: pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and bamboo mosaic virus 
      (BaMV). We show that SrtA can allow the attachment of long peptides [Influenza M2e 
      peptide (26 amino acids) and the HIV-1 T20 peptide (39 amino acids)] to PapMV 
      nanoparticles. Consistent with our PapMV structural model, we show that around 30% 
      of PapMV CP subunits in each nanoparticle can be fused to the peptide antigen. As 
      predicted, engineered nanoparticles were capable of inducing a strong antibody 
      response to the fused antigen. Finally, in a challenge study with influenza virus, 
      we show that mice vaccinated with PapMV-M2e are protected from infection. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This technology will allow the development of vaccines harbouring long 
      peptides containing several B and/or T cell epitopes that can contribute to a broad 
      and robust protection from infection. The design can be fast, versatile and can be 
      adapted to the development of vaccines for many infectious diseases as well as 
      cancer vaccines.

      Isopeptide Ligation.
PG  - 1058-1066

AB  - Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have demonstrated great therapeutic potential due to 
      their ability to target the delivery of potent cytotoxins. However, the 
      heterogeneous nature of conventional drug conjugation strategies can affect the 
      safety, efficacy, and stability of ADCs. Site-specific conjugations can resolve 
      these issues, but often require genetic modification of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), 
      which can impact yield or cost of production, or require undesirable chemical 
      linkages. Here, we describe a near-traceless conjugation method that enables the 
      efficient modification of native IgG, without the need for genetic engineering or 
      glycan modification. This method utilizes engineered variants of sortase A to 
      catalyze noncanonical isopeptide ligation. Sortase A was fused to an 
      antibody-binding domain to improve ligation efficiency. Antibody labeling is limited 
      to five lysine residues on the heavy chain and one on the light chain of human IgG1. 
      The ADCs exhibit conserved antigen and Fc-receptor interactions, as well as potent 
      cytolytic activity.

      contains an unusual active site architecture.
PG  - 23433-43
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.135434 [doi]
AB  - The pathogen Bacillus anthracis uses the Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme to anchor proteins 
      to its cell wall envelope during vegetative growth. To gain insight into the 
      mechanism of protein attachment to the cell wall in B. anthracis we investigated the 
      structure, backbone dynamics, and function of SrtA. The NMR structure of SrtA has 
      been determined with a backbone coordinate precision of 0.40 +/- 0.07 A. SrtA 
      possesses several novel features not previously observed in sortase enzymes 
      including the presence of a structurally ordered amino terminus positioned within 
      the active site and in contact with catalytically essential histidine residue 
      (His(126)). We propose that this appendage, in combination with a unique flexible 
      active site loop, mediates the recognition of lipid II, the second substrate to 
      which proteins are attached during the anchoring reaction. pK(a) measurements 
      indicate that His(126) is uncharged at physiological pH compatible with the enzyme 
      operating through a "reverse protonation" mechanism. Interestingly, NMR relaxation 
      measurements and the results of a model building study suggest that SrtA recognizes 
      the LPXTG sorting signal through a lock-in-key mechanism in contrast to the 
      prototypical SrtA enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most frequent causes of nosocomial and 
      community-acquired infections, with emerging multiresistant isolates causing a 
      significant burden to public health systems. We identified 2-sulfonylpyrimidines as 
      a new class of potent inhibitors against S. aureus sortase A acting by covalent 
      modification of the active site cysteine 184. Series of derivatives were synthesized 
      to derive structure-activity relationship (SAR) with the most potent compounds 
      displaying low micromolar K(I) values. Studies on the inhibition selectivity of 
      homologous cysteine proteases showed that 2-sulfonylpyrimidines reacted efficiently 
      with protonated cysteine residues as found in sortase A, though surprisingly, no 
      reaction occurred with the more nucleophilic cysteine residue from 
      imidazolinium-thiolate dyads of cathepsin-like proteases. By means of enzymatic and 
      chemical kinetics as well as quantum chemical calculations, it could be rationalized 
      that the S (N) Ar reaction between protonated cysteine residues and 
      2-sulfonylpyrimidines proceeds in a concerted fashion, and the mechanism involves a 
      ternary transition state with a conjugated base. Molecular docking and enzyme 
      inhibition at variable pH values allowed us to hypothesize that in sortase A this 
      base is represented by the catalytic histidine 120, which could be substantiated by 
      QM model calculation with 4-methylimidazole as histidine analog.

AB  - Most tumor-associated proteins are located inside tumor cells and thus are not 
      accessible to current marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies or their cytotoxic 
      conjugates. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I can present peptides derived from 
      intracellular tumor-associated proteins and somatically mutated proteins on the 
      cell's surface, forming an HLA/peptide complex as tumor-specific antigens for T cell 
      receptor (TCR) recognition. Therefore, HLA-mediated presentation of intracellular 
      tumor antigen peptides provides a viable way to distinguish tumor cells from normal 
      cells, which is important for broadening antigen selection, especially for 
      antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) regarding their highly cytotoxic payload. We applied 
      sortase A-mediated conjugation to develop TCR-like ADCs (i.e., EA1 HL-vcMMAE) 
      targeting intracellular MART-1 protein, a melanocyte-differentiating antigen 
      specific for metastatic melanomas, via the cell surface HLA-A2/MART-1(26-35) peptide 
      complex. Homogenous EA1 HL-vcMMAE (drug to antibody ratio of 4) efficiently 
      eliminated melanoma cells in xenograft mouse models with no obvious toxicity at the 
      therapeutic dosage. Trametinib, an MEK inhibitor serving as an HLA expression 
      enhancing agent, augmented the TL-ADCs' efficacy both in vitro and in vivo by 
      upregulating MART-1(26-35) peptide presentation, thus providing a strategy for 
      overcoming the limitation of antigen presentation level for TL-ADCs. Hence, our 
      findings validate the strategy of using sortase A-generated TL-ADCs to target 
      tumor-specific intracellular proteins, with or without agents present, to increase 
      presenting TCR epitope peptides.

PG  - 4088-4097
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.2007/007252-0 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is required for cell-wall anchoring of LPXTG-containing 
      Gram-positive surface proteins. It was hypothesized, therefore, that disruption of 
      the srtA gene would alter surface anchoring and functions of target LPXTG 
      motif-bearing SspA and SspB proteins of Streptococcus gordonii. Mutant strains in 
      srtA (V288srtA(-), DL1srtA(-)) were constructed in S. gordonii V288 (wtV288) and DL1 
      (wtDL1). When compared to wtV288, the V288srtA(-) mutant showed decreased biofilm 
      formation on polystyrene, and reduced binding to immobilized purified salivary 
      agglutinin (BIAcore analysis). The wtV288 and V288srtA(-) strains were similar in 
      ultrastructure, but immunogold-labelled SspA/SspB surface expression was reduced on 
      the V288srtA(-) mutant. DL1srtA(-) was also complemented to obtain DL1srtA(+). From 
      the wild-type strains (wtV288, wtDL1), srtA(-) mutants (V288srtA(-), DL1srtA(-)), 
      and the complemented mutant (DL1srtA(+)), cytoplasmic, cell-wall and released 
      extracellular protein fractions were isolated. Each fraction was analysed by 
      SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-P1. Spent medium from srtA(-) mutant cells 
      contained over-represented proteins, including SspA/SspB (P1 antigen). Mutants 
      showed less P1 on the cell surface than wild-types, as estimated using whole-cell 
      ELISA, and no P1 appeared in the cytoplasmic fractions. Expression of several 
      adhesin genes (sspA/B, cshA/B, fbpA) was generally upregulated in the mutants 
      (V288srtA(-), DL1srtA(-)), but restored to wild-type levels in DL1srtA(+). These 
      data therefore imply that in addition to its role in processing LPXTG-containing 
      adhesins, sortase A has the novel function of contributing to transcriptional 
      regulation of adhesin gene expression.

TI  - Site-Specific Protein Labeling via Sortase-Mediated Transpeptidation.
PG  - 15.3.1-15.3.19
LID - 10.1002/cpps.38 [doi]
AB  - Strategies for site-specific protein modification are highly desirable for the 
      construction of conjugates containing non-genetically-encoded functional groups. 
      Ideally, these strategies should proceed under mild conditions, and be compatible 
      with a wide range of protein targets and non-natural moieties. The transpeptidation 
      reaction catalyzed by bacterial sortases is a prominent strategy for protein 
      derivatization that possesses these features. Naturally occurring or engineered 
      variants of sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus catalyze a ligation reaction 
      between a five-amino-acid substrate motif (LPXTG) and oligoglycine nucleophiles. By 
      pairing proteins and synthetic peptides that possess these ligation handles, it is 
      possible to install modifications onto the protein N- or C-terminus in site-specific 
      fashion. As described in this unit, the successful implementation of 
      sortase-mediated labeling involves straightforward solid-phase synthesis and 
      molecular biology techniques, and this method is compatible with proteins in 
      solution or on the surface of live cells. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a transpeptidase widely used to site-specifically modify 
      peptides and proteins and shows promise for industrial applications. In this study, 
      a novel strategy was developed for constructing immobilized-SrtA as a robust and 
      recyclable enzyme via direct immobilization of extracellularly expressed SrtA in the 
      fermentation supernatant using magnetic particles. Efficient extracellular SrtA 
      expression was achieved in Escherichia coli through molecular engineering, including 
      manipulation of the protein transport pathway, codon optimization, and co-expression 
      of molecular chaperones to promote expressed SrtA secretion into the medium at high 
      levels. Subsequently, a simple one-step protocol was established for the 
      purification and immobilization of SrtA containing a His-tag from the fermentation 
      supernatant onto a nickel-modified magnetic particle. The immobilized SrtA was 
      proved to retain full enzymatic activity for peptide-to-peptide ligation and protein 
      modification, and was successfully reused for five cycles without obvious activity 
      loss.

AB  - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major health concern 
      which has brought about an urgent need for new therapeutic agents. As the S. aureus 
      Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme contributes to the adherence of the bacteria to the host 
      cells, inhibition thereof by small molecules could be employed as potential 
      antivirulence agents, also towards resistant strains. Albeit several virtual docking 
      SrtA campaigns have been reported, no strongly inhibitatory non-covalent binders 
      have as yet emerged therefrom. In order to better understand the binding modes of 
      small molecules, and the effect of different receptor structures employed in the 
      screening, we herein report on an exploratory study employing 10 known binders and 
      500 decoys on 100 SrtA structures generated from regular or steered molecular 
      dynamics simulations on four different SrtA crystal/NMR structures. The results 
      suggest a correlation between the protein structural flexibility and the virtual 
      screening performance, and confirm the noted immobilization of the β6/β7 loop upon 
      substrate binding. The NMR structures reported appear to perform slightly better 
      than the Xray-crystal structures, but the binding modes fluctuate tremendously, and 
      it might be suspected that the catalytic site is not necessarily the preferred site 
      of binding for some of the reported active compounds.

      efficiency].
PG  - 284-93
AB  - Efforts on directed evolution of sortase A to optimize its catalytic properties have 
      been undertaken and shown the promise. To facilitate screening of sortase A mutants 
      with expected catalytic properties, a novel ligation efficiency monitoring system, 
      including reporter substrates GFP-LPETG and GGGYK-Biotin, was developed. GFP-LPETG, 
      wild type sortase A, and a recently reported high activity sortase A mutant were 
      prepared recombinantly from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Taking advantage of the 
      newly designed reporter system, the ligation efficiency catalyzed by wild type and 
      mutant form of sortase A could be sensitively monitored via SDS-PAGE directly. 
      Consistent with previous report, the mutant sortase A displayed much higher 
      catalytic activity compared to wild type enzyme, indicating the new reporter system 
      is easily and fast handled and sensitive. The application of this reporter system 
      into systemic screening will facilitate future directed optimization of sortase A.

AB  - Disulfide-rich cyclic peptides have generated great interest in the development of 
      peptide-based therapeutics due to their exceptional stability toward chemical, 
      enzymatic, or thermal attack. In particular, they have been used as scaffolds onto 
      which bioactive epitopes can be grafted to take advantage of the favorable 
      biophysical properties of disulfide-rich cyclic peptides. To date, the most commonly 
      used method for the head-to-tail cyclization of peptides has been native chemical 
      ligation. In recent years, however, enzyme-mediated cyclization has become a 
      promising new technology due to its efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness. 
      Sortase A (SrtA) is a bacterial enzyme with transpeptidase activity. It recognizes a 
      C-terminal penta-amino acid motif, LPXTG, and cleaves the amide bond between Thr and 
      Gly to form a thioacyl-linked intermediate. This intermediate undergoes nucleophilic 
      attack by an N-terminal poly-Gly sequence to form an amide bond between the Thr and 
      N-terminal Gly. Here, we demonstrate that sortase A can successfully be used to 
      cyclize a variety of small disulfide-rich peptides, including the cyclotide kalata 
      B1, α-conotoxin Vc1.1, and sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1. These peptides range in 
      size from 14 to 29 amino acids and contain three, two, or one disulfide bond, 
      respectively, within their head-to-tail cyclic backbones. Our findings provide proof 
      of concept for the potential broad applicability of enzymatic cyclization of 
      disulfide-rich peptides with therapeutic potential.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sortase A (SrtA) is a transpeptidase found in Staphylococcus aureus, 
      which is widely used in site-specific protein modification. However, SrtA was 
      expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) in rather low level (ranging from several 
      milligrams to 76.9 mg/L at most). The present study aims to optimize fermentation 
      conditions for improving SrtA expression in E. coli. RESULTS: Under the optimized 
      media (0.48 g/L glycerol, 1.37 g/L tryptone, 0.51 g/L yeast extract, MOPS 0.5 g/L, 
      PBS buffer 180 mL/L) and condition (30 °C for 8 h) in a 7-L fermentor, the enzyme 
      activity and the yield of SrtA reached 2458.4 ± 115.9 U/mg DCW and 
      232.4 ± 21.1 mg/L, respectively, which were higher by 5.8- and 4.5-folds compared 
      with initial conditions, respectively. The yield of SrtA also represented threefold 
      increase than the previously reported maximal level. In addition, the enzymatic 
      characterizations of SrtA (optimal temperature, optimal pH, the influence of metal 
      irons, and tolerance to water-soluble organic solvents) were determined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced expression of SrtA was achieved by optimization of medium and 
      condition. This result will have potential application for production levels of SrtA 
      on an industry scale. Moreover, the detailed enzymatic characterizations of SrtA 
      were examined, which will provide a useful guide for its future application.

AB  - Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the main etiological agent of dental caries, and 
      adheres to the tooth surface through the sortase A (SrtA)-mediated cell 
      wall-anchored protein Pac. Inhibition of SrtA activity results in a marked reduction 
      in the adhesion potential of S. mutans, and the frequency of dental caries. Morin is 
      a natural plant extract that was previously reported to inhibit Staphylococcus 
      aureus SrtA activity. Here, we demonstrate that morin has an inhibitory effect 
      against S. mutans UA159 SrtA, with an IC50 of 27.2 ± 2.6 μM. Western blotting 
      demonstrated that 30 μM morin induced the partial release of the Pac protein into 
      the supernatant. The biofilm mass of S. mutans was reduced in the presence of 30 μM 
      morin, which was not caused by a decrease in S. mutans viability. These results 
      indicate that morin might be important as a new agent to prevent caries.

AB  - Sortase mediated transpeptidation reactions play a significant role in covalent 
      attachment of surface proteins to the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Earlier 
      studies have shown that sortase A (StrA) is required for the virulence of 
      Staphylococci. The human pathogen Staphylococcus simulans CJ16 carries a putative 
      sortase A (SsiStrA) encoding gene, but neither transpeptidation activity nor 
      biochemical characteristics of SsiStrA have been investigated. Here, we identified 
      and characterized StrA from coagulase-negative Staphylococci. SsiStrA was cloned and 
      overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 in a soluble form. Size-exclusion 
      chromatography, cross-linking and dynamic light scattering demonstrated that SsiStrA 
      existed as monomer-dimer equilibrium in vitro. We further demonstrated that SsiStrA 
      has sortase activity, and it recognized and cleaved the sorting motif LXPTG. H117, 
      C180 and R193 residues were critical for enzyme activity, and calcium ions enhanced 
      activity.

      Nanomedicine.
PG  - 67-80
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9654-4_6 [doi]
AB  - The current advances in nanoengineered materials coupled with the precise targeting 
      capability of recombinant antibodies can create nanoscale diagnostics and 
      therapeutics which show enhanced accumulation and extended retention at a target 
      tissue. Smaller antibodies such as single-chain variable fragments (scFv) preserve 
      the selective and strong binding of their parent antibody to their antigen with the 
      benefits of low immunogenicity, more efficient tissue penetration and easy 
      introduction of functional residues suitable for site-specific conjugation. This is 
      of high importance as nonspecific antibody modification often involves attachment to 
      free cysteine or lysine amino acids which may reside in the active site, leading to 
      reduced antigen binding.In this chapter, we outline a facile and versatile 
      chemoenzymatic approach for production of targeted nanocarrier scFv conjugates using 
      the bacterial trans-peptidase Sortase A (Srt A). Srt A efficiently mediates 
      sequence-specific peptide ligation under mild conditions and has few undesirable 
      side reactions. We first describe the production, purification and characterization 
      of Srt A enzyme and a scFv construct which targets activated platelets, called 
      scFv(anti-GPIIb/IIIa). Following this, our protocol illustrates the chemoenzymatic 
      modification of the antibody at the C-terminus with an orthogonal click chemistry 
      linker. This avoids any random attachment to the biologically active antigen binding 
      site of the antibody. Finally, we describe the modification of a nanoparticle 
      surface with scFv attachment via two methods: (1) direct Sortase-mediated 
      conjugation; or (2) a two-step system which consists of scFv Sortase-mediated 
      conjugation followed by strain promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Finally, 
      methodology is described to assess the successful assembly of targeted particles.

TI  - In vivo sortase A and clumping factor A mRNA expression during Staphylococcus aureus 
      infection.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus cell surface protein clumping factor A (ClfA) and the 
      enzyme sortase A (SrtA), which attach surface proteins to the cell wall, have both 
      been shown to be virulence factors in models of septic arthritis and sepsis. The 
      mRNA levels of clfA, srtA and the putative housekeeping gene gyrase B (gyrB) in S. 
      aureus were determined using real-time PCR during the course of sepsis/septic 
      arthritis. Expression was measured in joints, being a target of localized infection, 
      and in kidneys, representing a systemic compartment. In infected kidneys, the mRNA 
      levels of clfA, srtA and gyrB were all decreasing over time, from day 3 of infection 
      to day 14. The transcript numbers of clfA and srtA decreased faster in septic mice 
      than in mice with a non-septic disease. The mRNA levels of clfA and gyrB in joints, 
      though, were increasing during the course of infection. These differences suggest 
      that the specific tissue environment is decisive for the differentiation of 
      staphylococci. Also, there was a negative relationship between bacterial load in a 
      tissue and the numbers of clfA, srtA and gyrB transcripts per colony-forming unit. 
      Possibly enters the majority of bacteria a metabolically dormant steady state at 
      high bacterial loads.

AB  - Antibody labelling to reporter molecules is gaining popularity due to its many 
      potential applications for diagnostics and therapeutics. However, non-directional 
      bioconjugation methods which are commonly used often results in the loss of target 
      binding capabilities. Therefore, a site-specific enzymatic based bioconjugation such 
      as sortase-mediated transpeptidation allows for a more rapid and efficient method of 
      antibody conjugation for diagnostic applications. Here we describe the utilization 
      of sortase A bioconjugation to conjugate a single chain fragment variable (scFv) to 
      the extracellular invertase (invB) from Zymomonas mobilis with the aim of developing 
      an invertase based immunoassay. In addition, conjugation to enhanced green 
      fluorescent protein (eGFP) was also validated to show the flexibility of the method. 
      The invertase conjugated complex was successfully applied for the detection of 
      antibody-antigen interaction using a personal glucose meter (PGM) for assay readout. 
      The setup was used in both a direct and competitive assay highlighting the 
      robustness of the conjugate for assay development. The method provides an 
      alternative conjugation process to allow easy exchange of antibodies to facilitate 
      rapid development of diagnostic assays for various diseases on the PGM platform.

AB  - Enzyme-mediated protein conjugation has gained great attention recently due to the 
      remarkable site-selectivity and mild reaction condition affected by the nature of 
      enzyme. Among all sorts of enzymes reported, sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus 
      (SaSrtA) is the most popular enzyme due to its selectivity and well-demonstrated 
      applications. Position scanning has been widely applied to understand enzyme 
      substrate specificity, but the low throughput of chemical synthesis of peptide 
      substrates and analytical methods (HPLC, LC-ESI-MS) have been the major hurdle to 
      fully decode enzyme substrate profile. We have developed a simple high-throughput 
      substrate profiling method to reveal novel substrates of SaSrtA 7M, a widely used 
      hyperactive peptide ligase, by modified protein-fragment complementation assay 
      (PCA). A small library targeting the LPATG motif recognized by SaSrtA 7M was 
      generated and screened against proteins carrying N-terminal glycine. Using this 
      method, we have confirmed all currently known substrates of the enzyme, and moreover 
      identified some previously unknown substrates with varying activities. The method 
      provides an easy, fast and highly-sensitive way to determine substrate profile of a 
      peptide ligase in a high-throughput manner.

TI  - Segmental Isotope Labelling of an Individual Bromodomain of a Tandem Domain BRD4 
      Using Sortase A.

LID - e0154607
AB  - Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are one of the major readers 
      of epigenetic marks and an important target class in oncology and other disease 
      areas. The importance of the BET family of proteins is manifested by the explosion 
      in the number of inhibitors against these targets that have successfully entered 
      clinical trials. One important BET family member is bromodomain containing protein 4 
      (BRD4). Structural and biophysical studies of BRD4 are complicated by its 
      tertiary-structure consisting of two bromodomains connected by a flexible 
      inter-domain linker of approximately 180 amino acids. A detailed understanding of 
      the interplay of these bromodomains will be key to rational drug design in BRD4, yet 
      there are no reported three-dimensional structures of the multi-domain BRD4 and NMR 
      studies of the tandem domain are hampered by the size of the protein. Here, we 
      present a method for rapid Sortase A-mediated segmental labelling of the individual 
      bromodomains of BRD4 that provides a powerful strategy that will enable NMR studies 
      of ligand-bromodomain interactions with atomic detail. In our labelling strategy, we 
      have used U-[2H,15N]-isotope labelling on the C-terminal bromodomain with selective 
      introduction of 13CH3 methyl groups on Ile (δ1), Val and Leu, whereas the N-terminal 
      bromodomain remained unlabelled. This labelling scheme resulted in significantly 
      simplified NMR spectra and will allow for high-resolution interaction, structure and 
      dynamics studies in the presence of ligands.

TI  - Incorporation of a Valine-Leucine-Lysine-Containing Substrate in the Bacterial Cell 
      Wall.
PG  - 2418-2423
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a major public health threat, and 
      therefore novel antimicrobial targets and strategies are urgently needed. In this 
      regard, cell-wall-associated proteases are envisaged as interesting antimicrobial 
      targets due to their role in cell wall remodeling. Here, we describe the discovery 
      and characteristics of a protease substrate that is processed by a bacterial 
      cell-wall-associated protease. Stationary-phase grown Gram-positive bacteria were 
      incubated with fluorogenic protease substrates, and their cleavage and covalent 
      incorporation into the cell wall was analyzed. Of all of the substrates used, only 
      one substrate, containing a valine-leucine-lysine (VLK) motif, was covalently 
      incorporated into the bacterial cell wall. Linkage of the VLK-peptide substrate 
      appeared unrelated to sortase A and B activity, as both wild-type and sortase A and 
      B knock out Staphylococcus aureus strains incorporated this substrate into their 
      cell wall with comparable efficiency. Additionally, the VLK-peptide substrate showed 
      significantly higher incorporation in the cell wall of VanA-positive Enterococcus 
      faecium strains than in VanB- and vancomycin-susceptible isolates. In conclusion, 
      the VLK-peptide substrate identified in this study shows promise as a vehicle for 
      targeting antimicrobial compounds and diagnostic contrast agents to the bacterial 
      cell wall.

AB  - Streptavidin is tetrameric protein which has tight and specific biotin binding 
      affinity, and streptavidin modification of proteins or small molecules is widely 
      used for biotechnology tool. Here, we demonstrate site-specific streptavidin-protein 
      conjugation using enzymes. We focused on sortase A, a transpeptidase from 
      Staphylococcus aureus. A streptavidin-tagged LPETG motif (Stav-LPETG) was expressed 
      in Escherichia coli. We achieved soluble streptavidin expression in E. coli without 
      refolding using a cold shock expression system. Then we successfully conjugated 
      Stav-LPETG with pentaglycine-appended green fluorescence protein (Gly5-GFP) or 
      triglycine-appended glucose oxidase (Gly3-GOD) using sortase A. SDS-PAGE analysis 
      showed site-specific tetrameric streptavidin-protein conjugation with the tagged 
      proteins. In addition, the functions of a Stav-GOD conjugate, i.e., biotin-binding 
      and glucose oxidase activity, were significantly higher compared to those of 
      streptavidin-GOD conjugates prepared by chemical modification.

AB  - Sortases are key virulence factors in Gram-positive bacteria. These enzymes embed 
      surface proteins in the cell wall through a transpeptidation reaction that involves 
      recognizing a penta-peptide "sorting signal" in a target protein, cleaving it, and 
      covalently attaching it to a second substrate that is later inserted into the cell 
      wall. Although well studied, several aspects of the mechanism by which sortases 
      perform these functions remains unclear. In particular, experiments have revealed 
      two potential sorting signal binding motifs: a "Threonine-Out" (Thr-Out) structure 
      in which the catalytically critical threonine residues protrudes into solution, and 
      a "Threonine-In" (Thr-In) configuration in which this residue inserts into the 
      binding site. To determine which of these is the biologically relevant state, we 
      have performed a series of conventional and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular 
      mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations of the Staphylococcus aureus 
      sortase A (SrtA) enzyme bound to a sorting signal substrate. Through the use of 
      multi-dimensional metadynamics, our simulations were able to both map the acylation 
      mechanism of SrtA in the Thr-In and Thr-Out states, as well as determine the free 
      energy minima and barriers along these reactions. Results indicate that in both 
      states the catalytic mechanisms are similar, however the free energy barriers are 
      lower in the Thr-In configuration, suggesting that Thr-In is the catalytically 
      relevant state. This has important implications for advancing our understanding of 
      the mechanisms of sortase enzymes, as well we for future structure based drug design 
      efforts aimed at inhibiting sortase function in vivo.

AB  - Sortases are cell-membrane-anchored cysteine transpeptidases that are essential for 
      the assembly and anchoring of cell-surface adhesins in Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, 
      they play critical roles in virulence, infection and colonization by pathogens. 
      Sortases have been classified into four types based on their primary sequence and 
      the target-protein motifs that they recognize. All Gram-positive bacteria express a 
      class A housekeeping sortase (SrtA). Sortase A from Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      (NP_358691) has been crystallized in two crystal forms. Diamond-shaped crystals of 
      ΔN(59)SrtA diffracted to 4.0 Å resolution and belonged to a tetragonal system with 
      unit-cell parameters a = b = 122.8, c = 86.5 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, while rod-shaped 
      crystals of ΔN(81)SrtA diffracted to 2.91 Å resolution and belonged to the 
      monoclinic space group P2(1) with unit-cell parameters a = 66.8, b = 103.47, c = 
      74.79 Å, α = γ = 90, β = 115.65°. The Matthews coefficient (V(M) = 2.77 Å(3) Da(-1)) 
      with ~56% solvent content suggested the presence of four molecules in the asymmetric 
      unit for ΔN(81)SrtA. Also, a multi-copy search using a monomer as a probe in the 
      molecular-replacement method resulted in the successful location of four sortase 
      molecules in the asymmetric unit, with statistics R = 41.61, R(free) = 46.44, 
      correlation coefficient (CC) = 64.31, CC(free) = 57.67.

AB  - A Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase, sortase A (SrtA), which catalyzes a peptide 
      ligation with high substrate specificity, is a useful tool to site-specifically 
      attach proteinaceous/peptidic functional molecules to target proteins. However, its 
      strong Ca(2+) dependency makes SrtA difficult for use under low Ca(2+) 
      concentrations and in the presence of Ca(2+)-binding substances. To overcome this 
      problem, we designed a SrtA mutant that Ca(2+)-independently demonstrates a high 
      catalytic activity. The heptamutant (P94R/E105K/E108A/D160N/D165A/K190E/K196T), 
      which resulted from a combination of known mutations at the Ca(2+) -binding site and 
      around the substrate-binding site, successfully catalyzed a selective 
      protein-protein ligation in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Selective protein 
      modification in living cells is a promising approach for investigating cellular 
      events and regulating cell functions. This SrtA mutant may prove to be a versatile 
      tool for adding new functionalities to proteins of interest by incorporating 
      functional proteins and chemically modified peptides in living cells, which usually 
      retain low Ca(2+) concentrations.

AB  - Protein assemblies are an emerging tool that is finding many biological and 
      bioengineering applications. We here propose a method for the site-specific assembly 
      of proteins on a twigged streptavidin (SA) polymer using streptavidin as a 
      functional scaffold. SA was genetically appended with a G tag (sortase A recognition 
      sequence) and a Y tag (HRP recognition sequence) on its N- and C-termini, 
      respectively, to provide G-SA-Y. G-SA-Y was polymerized using HPR-mediated tyrosine 
      coupling, then fluorescent proteins were immobilized on the polymer by biotin-SA 
      affinity and sortase A-mediated ligation. Fluorescence measurements showed that the 
      proteins were immobilized in close proximity to each other. Hydrolyzing enzymes were 
      also functionally assembled on the G-SA-Y polymer. The site-specific assembly of 
      proteins on twigged SA polymer may find new applications in various biological and 
      bioengineering fields.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sortase A is an enzyme responsible for the covalent attachment of Pac 
      proteins to the cell wall in Streptococcus mutans. It has been shown to play a role 
      in modulating the surface properties and the biofilm formation and influence the 
      cariogenicity of S. mutans. Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric, was reported 
      to be an inhibitor for Staphylococcus aureus sortase A. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the inhibitory ability of curcumin against S. mutans sortase A and the 
      effect of curcumin for biofilm formation. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the 
      curcumin to the S. mutans and inhibitory ability of the curcumin against the 
      purified sortase A in vitro were detected. Western-blot and real-time PCR were used 
      to analysis the sortase A mediated Pac protein changes when the S. mutans was 
      cultured with curcumin. The curcumin on the S. mutans biofilm formation was 
      determined by biofilm formation analysis. RESULTS: Curcumin can inhibit purified S. 
      mutans sortase A with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 
      (10.2±0.7)μmol/l, which is lower than minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 
      175μmol/l. Curcumin (15μmol/l) was found to release the Pac protein to the 
      supernatant and reduce S. mutans biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      indicated that curcumin is an S. mutans sortase A inhibitor and has promising 
      anti-caries characteristics through an anti-adhesion-mediated mechanism.

AB  - Targeted delivery or "smart delivery" of pharmaceutical or imaging agents and even 
      entire cells such as stem cells is an emerging trend in modern biotechnology. A 
      binding ligand such as an antibody that can specifically bind to receptors expressed 
      at a disease site is an essential component of such constructs. Different chemical 
      methods have been widely used to apply antibodies for delivery systems; however, 
      they typically result in impairment or loss of antibody functionality. 
      Enzyme-mediated conjugation approaches have been developed to overcome this major 
      disadvantage of conventional chemical methods. Sortase, an enzyme derived from 
      Staphylococcus aureus, is able to provide a biochemically robust, highly 
      reproducible, and site-specific coupling method for the conjugation of antibodies to 
      pharmaceutical agents, nanoparticles, and cells for drug delivery, molecular 
      imaging, and cell homing. Here, we review the use of sortase and other enzyme-based 
      methods as bioconjugation tools with a focus on cardiovascular applications.

AB  - Sortases are a family of Gram-positive transpeptidases responsible for anchoring 
      surface protein virulence factors to the peptidoglycan cell wall layer. In 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), deletion of sortase isoform results in a 
      significant reduction in virulence and infection potential. Twenty flavonoids were 
      isolated from the stem of the folk medicinal plant Spatholobus suberectus Dunn. 
      These compounds were tested against S. aureus-derived sortase A (SrtA), a key 
      transpeptidase for bacterial virulence. Among these active flavonoids, 
      7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-flavanone (3) and formononetin (10) were identified as compounds 
      with promising SrtA inhibitory activity. These compounds also exhibited inhibitory 
      activity against S. aureus cell clumping to fibrinogen. The suppression of 
      cell-clumping activity indicates the potential of these compounds in the treatment 
      of S. aureus infections via the inhibition of SrtA.

TI  - Ca2+ binding induced sequential allosteric activation of sortase A: An example for 
      ion-triggered conformational selection.
PG  - e0205057

LID - e0205057
AB  - The allosteric activation of the intrinsically disordered enzyme Staphylococcus 
      aureus sortase A is initiated via binding of a Ca2+ ion. Although Ca2+ binding was 
      shown to initiate structural changes inducing disorder-to-order transitions, the 
      details of the allosteric activation mechanism remain elusive. We performed 
      long-term molecular dynamics simulations of sortase A without (3 simulations of 1.6 
      μs) and with bound Ca2+ (simulations of 1.6 μs, 1.8 μs, and 2.5 μs). Our results 
      show that Ca2+ binding causes not only ordering of the disordered β6/β7 loop of the 
      protein, but also modulates hinge motions in the dynamic β7/β8 loop, which is 
      important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Cation binding triggers signal 
      transmission from the Ca2+ binding site to the dynamic β7/β8 loop via the repetitive 
      folding/unfolding of short helical stretches of the disordered β6/β7 loop. These 
      correlated structural rearrangements lead to several distinct conformational states 
      of the binding groove, which show optimal binding features for the sorting signal 
      motif and feature binding energies up to 20 kcal/mol more favorable than observed 
      for the sortase A without Ca2+. The presented results indicate a highly correlated, 
      conformational selection-based activation mechanism of the enzyme triggered by 
      cation binding. They also demonstrate the importance of the dynamics of 
      intrinsically disordered regions for allosteric regulation.

AB  - Sortases catalyze the attachment of surface proteins to the peptidoglycan layer of 
      gram-positive bacteria and further represent powerful tools of protein chemistry. 
      During catalysis sortases cleave a donor substrate containing the LPxTG (x=any amino 
      acid) sorting motif under formation of an enzyme-bound thioester and ligate this 
      intermediate to an acceptor protein containing an N-terminal glycine residue. In 
      addition to the well-established sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus several homologs 
      of this enzyme have been identified in the genomes of gram-positive bacteria. We 
      have profiled the specificity of seven sortases of Staphylococci and Streptococci 
      origin and observed that sortases of the latter class displayed a more relaxed 
      specificity for donor and acceptor substrates than their Staphylococci counterparts. 
      Streptococci sortases prefer an LPKLG donor substrate sequence compared to the 
      canonical sorting motif LPKTG. These findings might facilitate the use of 
      Streptococci sortases as tools of protein chemistry.

TI  - Quercitrin, an inhibitor of Sortase A, interferes with the adhesion of 
      Staphylococcal aureus.
PG  - 6533-43
LID - 10.3390/molecules20046533 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a cysteine transpeptidase of most Gram-positive bacteria that is 
      responsible for the anchorage of many surface protein virulence factors to the cell 
      wall layer. SrtA mutants are unable to display surface proteins and are defective in 
      the establishment of infections without affecting microbial viability. In this 
      study, we report that quercitrin (QEN), a natural compound that does not affect 
      Staphylococcus aureus growth, can inhibit the catalytic activity of SrtA in 
      fibrinogen (Fg) cell-clumping and immobilized fibronectin (Fn) adhesion assays. 
      Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays suggest that QEN binds to the 
      binding sites of the SrtA G167A and V193A mutants. These findings indicate that QEN 
      is a potential lead compound for the development of new anti-virulence agents 
      against S. aureus infections.

PG  - e25300
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0025300 [doi]
LID - e25300
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, also referred to as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is one of 
      the most common causes of life-threatening bacterial infections in infants. In 
      recent years cell surface pili have been identified in several Gram-positive 
      bacteria, including GBS, as important virulence factors and promising vaccine 
      candidates. In GBS, three structurally distinct types of pili have been discovered 
      (pilus 1, 2a and 2b), whose structural subunits are assembled in high-molecular 
      weight polymers by specific class C sortases. In addition, the highly conserved 
      housekeeping sortase A (SrtA), whose main role is to link surface proteins to 
      bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan by a transpeptidation reaction, is also involved 
      in pili cell wall anchoring in many bacteria. Through in vivo mutagenesis, we 
      demonstrate that the LPXTG sorting signal of the minor ancillary protein (AP2) is 
      essential for pilus 2a anchoring. We successfully produced a highly purified 
      recombinant SrtA (SrtA(ΔN40)) able to specifically hydrolyze the sorting signal of 
      pilus 2a minor ancillary protein (AP2-2a) and catalyze in vitro the transpeptidation 
      reaction between peptidoglycan analogues and the LPXTG motif, using both synthetic 
      fluorescent peptides and recombinant proteins. By contrast, SrtA(ΔN40) does not 
      catalyze the transpeptidation reaction with substrate-peptides mimicking sorting 
      signals of the other pilus 2a subunits (the backbone protein and the major ancillary 
      protein). Thus, our results add further insight into the proposed model of GBS pilus 
      2a assembly, in which SrtA is required for pili cell wall covalent attachment, 
      acting exclusively on the minor accessory pilin, representing the terminal subunit 
      located at the base of the pilus.

TI  - Conversion of an amide to a high-energy thioester by Staphylococcus aureus sortase A 
      is powered by variable binding affinity for calcium.
PG  - 16371
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-34752-6 [doi]
LID - 16371
AB  - Thioesters are key intermediates in biology, which often are generated from less 
      energy-rich amide precursors. Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) is an enzyme 
      widely used in biotechnology for peptide ligation. The reaction proceeds in two 
      steps, where the first step involves the conversion of an amide bond of substrate 
      peptide into a thioester intermediate with the enzyme. Here we show that the free 
      energy required for this step is matched by an about 30-fold increase in binding 
      affinity of a calcium ion at the calcium binding site of SrtA, which is remote from 
      the thioester bond. The magnitude of this allosteric effect highlights the 
      importance of calcium for the activity of SrtA. The increase in calcium binding 
      affinity upon binding of substrate not only achieves catalytic formation of an 
      energy-rich intermediate in the absence of nucleotide triphosphates or any tight 
      non-covalent enzyme-substrate interactions, but is also accompanied by accumulation 
      of the labile thioester intermediate, which makes it directly observable in nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.

AB  - Cell-laden hydrogels whose crosslinking density can be dynamically and reversibly 
      tuned are highly sought-after for studying pathophysiological cellular fate 
      processes, including embryogenesis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. Special efforts 
      have focused on controlling network crosslinking in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 
      based hydrogels to evaluate the impact of matrix mechanics on cell proliferation, 
      morphogenesis, and differentiation. In this study, we sought to design dynamic 
      PEG-peptide hydrogels that permit cyclic/reversible stiffening and softening. This 
      was achieved by utilizing reversible enzymatic reactions that afford specificity, 
      biorthogonality, and predictable reaction kinetics. To that end, we prepared 
      PEG-peptide conjugates to enable sortase A (SrtA) induced tunable hydrogel 
      crosslinking independent of macromer contents. Uniquely, these hydrogels can be 
      completely degraded by the same enzymatic reactions and the degradation rate can be 
      tuned from hours to days. We further synthesized SrtA-sensitive peptide linker 
      (i.e., KCLPRTGCK) for crosslinking with 8-arm PEG-norbornene (PEG8NB) via 
      thiol-norbornene photocrosslinking. These hydrogels afford diverse softening 
      paradigms through control of network structures during crosslinking or by adjusting 
      enzymatic parameters during on-demand softening. Importantly, user-controlled 
      hydrogel softening promoted spreading of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in 3D. 
      Finally, we designed a bis-cysteine-bearing linear peptide flanked with SrtA 
      substrates at the peptide's N- and C-termini (i.e., NH(2)-GGGCKGGGKCLPRTG-CONH(2)) 
      to enable cyclic/reversible hydrogel stiffening/softening. We show that matrix 
      stiffening and softening play a crucial role in growth and chemoresistance in 
      pancreatic cancer cells. These results represent the first dynamic hydrogel platform 
      that affords cyclic gel stiffening/softening based on reversible enzymatic 
      reactions. More importantly, the chemical motifs that affords such reversible 
      crosslinking were built-in on the linear peptide crosslinker without any 
      post-synthesis modification. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cell-laden 'dynamic' 
      hydrogels are typically designed to enable externally stimulated stiffening or 
      softening of the hydrogel network. However, no enzymatic reaction has been used to 
      reversibly control matrix crosslinking. The application of SrtA-mediated 
      transpeptidation in crosslinking and post-gelation modification of biomimetic 
      hydrogels is innovative because of the specificity of the reaction and reversible 
      tunability of crosslinking kinetics. While SrtA has been previously used to 
      crosslink and fully degrade hydrogels, matrix softening and reversible stiffening of 
      cell-laden hydrogels has not been reported. By designing simple peptide substrates, 
      this unique enzymatic reaction can be employed to form a primary network, to 
      gradually soften hydrogels, or to reversibly stiffen hydrogels. As a result, this 
      dynamic hydrogel platform can be used to answer important matrix-related biological 
      questions that are otherwise difficult to address.

AB  - A series of flavonoids (1-14) was isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens. We 
      evaluated their ability to inhibit both microbial growth and sortase A, an enzyme 
      that plays a key role in cell wall protein anchoring and virulence in Staphylococcus 
      aureus. Most prenylated flavonoids (7-13) displayed potent inhibitory activity 
      against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except E. coli, with minimum 
      inhibitory concentrations values ranging from 4.40 to 27.7 μM, and weak or no 
      activity against fungal strains tested. Kurarinol (6) was a potent inhibitor of 
      sortase A, with an IC(50) value of 107.7 ± 6.6 μM. A preliminary structure-activity 
      relationship, including essential structural requirements, is described.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most frequent cause of 
      hospital-acquired infection, which manifests as surgical site infections, 
      bacteremia, and sepsis. Due to drug-resistance, prophylaxis of MRSA infection with 
      antibiotics frequently fails or incites nosocomial diseases such as Clostridium 
      difficile infection. Sortase A is a transpeptidase that anchors surface proteins in 
      the envelope of S. aureus, and sortase mutants are unable to cause bacteremia or 
      sepsis in mice. Here we used virtual screening and optimization of inhibitor 
      structure to identify 
      3-(4-pyridinyl)-6-(2-sodiumsulfonatephenyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazole 
      and related compounds, which block sortase activity in vitro and in vivo. Sortase 
      inhibitors do not affect in vitro staphylococcal growth yet protect mice against 
      lethal S. aureus bacteremia. Thus, sortase inhibitors may be useful as antiinfective 
      therapy to prevent hospital-acquired S. aureus infection in high-risk patients 
      without the side effects of antibiotics.

AB  - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus has become a major health concern and it 
      requires new therapeutic agents. Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A enzyme contributes 
      in adherence of bacteria with the cell wall of host cell; consequently, inhibition 
      of S. aureus Sortase A by small molecules could be employed as potential 
      antibacterial agents against methicillin resistant S. aureus. Current study focused 
      on the identification of 3D pharmacophoric features within a series of rhodanine, 
      pyridazinone, and pyrazolethione analogs as S. aureus Sortase A inhibitors. 
      Pharmacophore model was constructed employing representative molecules using Genetic 
      Algorithm with Linear Assignment of Hypermolecular Alignment of Database. The 
      identified pharmacophoric points were then utilized to create alignment hypothesis 
      for three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships. Outcome of 
      comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity indices 
      analysis experiments were in good agreement (comparative molecular field analysis: 
      q(2) = 0.562 and r(2) = 0.995, comparative molecular similarity indices analysis: 
      q(2) = 0.549 and r(2) = 0.978) and capable of explaining the variance in biological 
      activities coherently with respect to the structural features of compounds. The 
      results were also found in concurrence with the outcome of pharmacophoric features.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A catalyzes the transpeptidation of an LPXTG peptide 
      acceptor and a glycine-linked peptide donor and has proven to be a powerful tool for 
      site-specific protein modification. The substrate specificity of sortase A is 
      stringent, limiting its broader utility. Here we report the laboratory evolution of 
      two orthogonal sortase A variants that recognize each of two altered substrates, 
      LAXTG and LPXSG, with high activity and specificity. Following nine rounds of yeast 
      display screening integrated with negative selection, the evolved sortases exhibit 
      specificity changes of up to 51,000-fold, relative to the starting sortase without 
      substantial loss of catalytic activity, and with up to 24-fold specificity for their 
      target substrates, relative to their next most active peptide substrate. The 
      specificities of these altered sortases are sufficiently orthogonal to enable the 
      simultaneous conjugation of multiple peptide substrates to their respective targets 
      in a single solution. We demonstrated the utility of these evolved sortases by using 
      them to effect the site-specific modification of endogenous fetuin A in human 
      plasma, the synthesis of tandem fluorophore-protein-PEG conjugates for two 
      therapeutically relevant fibroblast growth factor proteins (FGF1 and FGF2), and the 
      orthogonal conjugation of fluorescent peptides onto surfaces.

AB  - The transpeptidase sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa-SrtA) is a valuable tool 
      in protein chemistry. The native enzyme anchors surface proteins containing a highly 
      conserved LPxTG sorting motif to a terminal glycine residue of the peptidoglycan 
      layer in Gram-positive bacteria. This reaction is exploited for sortase-mediated 
      ligation (SML), allowing the site-specific linkage of synthetic peptides and 
      recombinant proteins by a native peptide bond. However, the moderate catalytic 
      efficiency and specificity of Sa-SrtA fueled the development of new biocatalysts for 
      SML, including the screening of sortase A variants form microorganisms other than S. 
      aureus and the directed protein evolution of the Sa-SrtA enzyme itself. Novel 
      display platforms and screening formats were developed to isolate sortases with 
      altered properties from mutant libraries. This yielded sortases with strongly 
      enhanced catalytic activity and enzymes recognizing new sorting motifs as 
      substrates. This minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of directed 
      sortase evolution and applications of these tailor-made enzymes in biochemistry.

AB  - The endogenous Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) transpeptidase covalently 
      anchors cell wall-anchored (CWA) proteins equipped with a specific recognition motif 
      (LPXTG) into the peptidoglycan layer of the staphylococcal cell wall. Previous in 
      situ experiments have shown that SrtA is also able to incorporate exogenous, 
      fluorescently labelled, synthetic substrates equipped with the LPXTG motif 
      (K(FITC)LPETG-amide) into the bacterial cell wall, albeit at high concentrations of 
      500 μM to 1 mM. In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of substrate 
      modification on the incorporation efficiency. This revealed that (i) by elongation 
      of LPETG-amide with a sequence of positively charged amino acids, derived from the 
      C-terminal domain of physiological SrtA substrates, the incorporation efficiency was 
      increased by 20-fold at 10 μM, 100 μM and 250 μM; (ii) Substituting aspartic acid 
      (E) for methionine increased the incorporation of the resulting K(FITC)LPMTG-amide 
      approximately three times at all concentrations tested; (iii) conjugation of the 
      lipid II binding antibiotic vancomycin to K(FITC)LPMTG-amide resulted in the same 
      incorporation levels as K(FITC)LPETG-amide, but much more efficient at an impressive 
      500-fold lower substrate concentration. These newly developed synthetic substrates 
      can potentially find broad applications in for example the in situ imaging of 
      bacteria; the incorporation of antibody recruiting moieties; the targeted delivery 
      and covalent incorporation of antimicrobial compounds into the bacterial cell wall.

AB  - Covalent attachment of surface proteins to the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria 
      requires a sortase-mediated transpeptidation reaction. In almost all Gram-positive 
      bacteria, the housekeeping sortase, sortase A, recognizes the canonical recognition 
      sequence LPXTG (X=any amino acid). The human pathogen Clostridium difficile carries 
      a single putative sortase gene (cd2718) but neither transpeptidation activity nor 
      specificity of CD2718 has been investigated. We produced recombinant CD2718 and 
      examined its transpeptidation activity in vitro using synthetic peptides and 
      MALDI-ToF(-ToF) MS analysis. We demonstrate that CD2718 has sortase activity with 
      specificity for a (S/P)PXTG motif and can accommodate diaminopimelic acid as a 
      substrate for transpeptidation.

AB  - A new maltol derivative (2) along with three known maltol derivative (1) and 
      flavonol glycosides (3 and 4) were isolated from the dried flowers of Sophora 
      japonica. Based upon the results of combined spectroscopic methods, the structure of 
      new compound (2) was determined to be 
      maltol-3-O-(4'-O-cis-p-coumaroyl-6'-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaroyl))-β-glucopyranoside, 
      an isomer of 1. These compounds strongly inhibited the action of sortase A (SrtA) 
      from Streptococcus mutans, a primary etiologic agent of human dental caries. The 
      onset and magnitude of inhibition of the saliva-induced aggregation in S. mutans 
      treated with compound 2 (4×IC50) were comparable to the behavior of untreated 
      srtA-deletion mutant.

AB  - Site-specific chemical modification of proteins can assist in the study of their 
      function. Furthermore, these methods are essential to develop biologicals for 
      diagnostic and therapeutic use. Standard protein engineering protocols and 
      recombinant expression enable the production of proteins with short peptide tags 
      recognized by enzymes capable of site-specific modification. We report here the 
      application of two enzymes of orthogonal specificity, sortase A and butelase 1, to 
      prepare non-natural C-to-C fusion proteins. Using these enzymes, we further 
      demonstrate site-selective installation of different chemical moieties at two sites 
      in a full-size antibody molecule.

TI  - Contribution of sortase A to the regulation of Listeria monocytogenes LPXTG surface 
      proteins.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Listeria contain many surface proteins 
      covalently bound to the peptidoglycan. In the pathogenic species Listeria 
      monocytogenes, some of these surface proteins mediate adhesion and entry into host 
      cells. Specialized enzymes called sortases anchor these proteins to the cell wall by 
      a mechanism involving processing and covalent linkage to the peptidoglycan. How 
      bacteria coordinate the production of sortases and their respective protein 
      substrates is currently unknown. The present work investigated whether the 
      functional status of the sortase influences the level at which its cognate 
      substrates are produced. The relative amounts of surface proteins containing an 
      LPXTG sorting motif recognized by sortase A (StrA) were determined in isogenic 
      wild-type and ΔsrtA strains of L. monocytogenes. The possibility of regulation at 
      the transcriptional level was also examined. The results showed that the absence of 
      SrtA did not affect the expression of any of the genes encoding LPXTG proteins. 
      However, marked differences were found at the protein level for some substrates 
      depending on the presence/absence of SrtA. In addition to the known "mis-sorting" of 
      some LPXTG proteins caused by the absence of SrtA, the total amount of certain LPXTG 
      protein species was lower in the ΔsrtA mutant. These data suggested that the rate of 
      synthesis and/or the stability of a subset of LPXTG proteins could be regulated 
      post-transcriptionally depending on the functionality of SrtA. For some LPXTG 
      proteins, the absence of SrtA resulted in only a partial loss of the protein that 
      remained bound to the peptidoglycan, thus providing support for additional modes of 
      cell-wall association in some members of the LPXTG surface protein family.

TI  - Role of sortase in Streptococcus mutans under the effect of nicotine.
PG  - 206-11
LID - 10.1038/ijos.2013.86 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a common Gram-positive bacterium and plays a significant 
      role in dental caries. Tobacco and/or nicotine have documented effects on S. mutans 
      growth and colonization. Sortase A is used by many Gram-positive bacteria, including 
      S. mutans, to facilitate the insertion of certain cell surface proteins, containing 
      an LPXTGX motif such as antigen I/II. This study examined the effect of nicotine on 
      the function of sortase A to control the physiology and growth of S. mutans using 
      wild-type S. mutans NG8, and its isogenic sortase-defective and -complemented 
      strains. Briefly, the strains were treated with increasing amounts of nicotine in 
      planktonic growth, biofilm metabolism, and sucrose-induced and saliva-induced 
      antigen I/II-dependent biofilm formation assays. The strains exhibited no 
      significant differences with different concentrations of nicotine in planktonic 
      growth assays. However, they had significantly increased (P≤0.05) biofilm metabolic 
      activity (2- to 3-fold increase) as the concentration of nicotine increased. 
      Furthermore, the sortase-defective strain was more sensitive metabolically to 
      nicotine than the wild-type or sortase-complemented strains. All strains had 
      significantly increased sucrose-induced biofilm formation (2- to 3-fold increase) as 
      a result of increasing concentrations of nicotine. However, the sortase-defective 
      strain was not able to make as much sucrose- and saliva-induced biofilm as the 
      wild-type NG8 did with increasing nicotine concentrations. These results indicated 
      that nicotine increased metabolic activity and sucrose-induced biofilm formation. 
      The saliva-induced biofilm formation assay and qPCR data suggested that antigen I/II 
      was upregulated with nicotine but biofilm was not able to be formed as much as 
      wild-type NG8 without functional sortase A.

TI  - Sortase A utilizes an ancillary protein anchor for efficient cell wall anchoring of 
      pili in Streptococcus agalactiae.
PG  - 3550-60
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01613-07 [doi]
AB  - Pili are putative virulence factors and promising vaccine candidates in 
      Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) infection, a leading cause of 
      neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The genes necessary for pilus synthesis and assembly 
      are clustered in pilus islands (PI). Each gene encodes three structural subunits (a 
      backbone and two ancillary proteins) bearing a C-terminal LPXTG motif and two 
      subfamily C sortases (SrtC) involved in covalent polymerization of the subunits. GBS 
      strains also possess the conserved "housekeeping" sortase A (SrtA), but its role in 
      pilus assembly is unclear. To address this issue, pilus expression and cell wall 
      anchoring were analyzed in srtA deletion mutants. Loss of SrtA did not affect pilus 
      polymerization. However, pilus expression on the cell surface was reduced, and pili 
      accumulated in the culture supernatant. Furthermore, cell-associated pili could be 
      readily released by detergent treatment, indicating that SrtA is involved in 
      covalent anchoring of pili to the cell wall. When each of the genes comprising PI-2a 
      was systematically deleted, only the absence of ancillary subunit GBS150 or the SrtC 
      required for incorporation of GBS150 into pili mimicked the srtA mutant phenotype. 
      Thus, from these data a model for GBS pilus assembly can be proposed in which PI 
      sortases are responsible for polymerization of the pilus structure, while SrtA is 
      required to covalently attach it to the cell wall, utilizing ancillary pilus subunit 
      GBS150 as the anchor protein.

TI  - Sorting sortases: a nomenclature proposal for the various sortases of Gram-positive 
      bacteria.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - Bacterial surface proteins constitute a diverse group of molecules with important 
      functions, such as adherence, invasion, signaling and interaction with the host 
      immune system or the environment. In Gram-positive bacteria, many surface proteins 
      are anchored to the cell wall envelope by an enzyme named sortase, which recognizes 
      a conserved carboxylic sorting motif. The sequence of the prototype staphylococcal 
      SrtA has been widely used to identify homologs in bacterial genomes, revealing a 
      profusion of sortases in almost all Gram-positive bacteria, often with more than one 
      sortase-like protein per genome [M.J. Pallen, A.C. Lam, M. Antonio, K. Dunbar, 
      Trends Microbiol. 9 (2001) 97-102]. In light of increasing reports on the 
      identification and/or characterization of paralogous sortase genes, a classification 
      of sortases now appears necessary. This report provides an analysis of sixty-one 
      sortases from complete Gram-positive genomes, and suggests the existence of four 
      structural groups of sortases. We propose the classification of sortases into 4 
      classes designated A, B, C and D. This classification should help to discriminate 
      between sortases in the future.

TI  - Synthetic LPETG-containing peptide incorporation in the Staphylococcus aureus 
      cell-wall in a sortase A- and growth phase-dependent manner.

AB  - The majority of Staphylococcus aureus virulence- and colonization-associated surface 
      proteins contain a pentapeptide recognition motif (LPXTG). This motif can be 
      recognized and cleaved by sortase A (SrtA) which is a membrane-bound transpeptidase. 
      After cleavage these proteins are covalently incorporated into the peptidoglycan. 
      Therefore, SrtA plays a key role in S. aureus virulence. We aimed to generate a 
      substrate mimicking this SrtA recognition motif for several purposes: to incorporate 
      this substrate into the S. aureus cell-wall in a SrtA-dependent manner, to 
      characterize this incorporation and to determine the effect of substrate 
      incorporation on the incorporation of native SrtA-dependent cell-surface-associated 
      proteins. We synthesized substrate containing the specific LPXTG motif, LPETG. As a 
      negative control we used a scrambled version of this substrate, EGTLP and a S. 
      aureus srtA knockout strain. Both substrates contained a fluorescence label for 
      detection by FACScan and fluorescence microscope. A spreading assay and a 
      competitive Luminex assay were used to determine the effect of substrate treatment 
      on native LPXTG containing proteins deposition in the bacterial cell-wall. We 
      demonstrate a SrtA-dependent covalent incorporation of the LPETG-containing 
      substrate in wild type S. aureus strains and several other Gram-positive bacterial 
      species. LPETG-containing substrate incorporation in S. aureus was growth 
      phase-dependent and peaked at the stationary phase. This incorporation negatively 
      correlated with srtA mRNA expression. Exogenous addition of the artificial substrate 
      did not result in a decreased expression of native SrtA substrates (e.g. clumping 
      factor A/B and protein A) nor induced a srtA knockout phenotype.

      chemoenzymatic synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins.
PG  - 1567-71
LID - 10.1021/ja906611x [doi]
AB  - Several peptides/small proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivatives 
      were synthesized and compared as substrates of sortase A (SrtA), a bacterial 
      transpeptidase, for enzymatic coupling. It was observed that peptides containing the 
      LPKTGGS and LPKTGGRS sequences as sorting signals at the peptide C-terminus were 
      effectively coupled to GPI derivatives having one or two glycine residues attached 
      to the phosphoethanolamine group at the nonreducing end. This reaction was employed 
      to prepare several analogues of the human CD52 and CD24 antigens, which are 
      naturally GPI-anchored glycopeptides/glycoproteins. It was further observed that the 
      trisaccharide GPI analogues 5 and 6 were better SrtA substrates than monosaccharide 
      GPI analogue 4, suggesting that steric hindrance of the GPI analogues does not 
      affect their peptidation reaction mediated by SrtA. Therefore, this synthetic 
      strategy may be useful for the preparation of more complex GPI-anchored peptides, 
      glycopeptides, proteins, and glycoproteins.

PG  - 1457-1460
LID - 10.4014/jmb.1704.04001 [doi]
AB  - Seven flavonoids were isolated from Spatholobus suberectus via repetitive column 
      chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The chemical structures 
      of these compounds were identified by spectroscopic analysis and comparison with 
      values reported in the literature. Among the flavonoids tested, 
      7-hydroxy-6-methoxyflavanone (1) and formononetin (4) exhibited strong inhibitory 
      activity against Streptococcus mutans SrtA, with IC(50) values of 46.1 and 41.8 µM, 
      respectively, but did not affect cell viability. The onset and magnitude of 
      inhibition of saliva-induced aggregation in S. mutans treated with compounds 1 and 4 
      were comparable to the behavior of a srtA-deletion mutant without treatment.

TI  - Sortase B, a new class of sortase in Listeria monocytogenes.
PG  - 1972-82
AB  - Sortases are transamidases that covalently link proteins to the peptidoglycan of 
      gram-positive bacteria. The genome of the pathogenic bacterium Listeria 
      monocytogenes encodes two sortases genes, srtA and srtB. The srtA gene product 
      anchors internalin and some other LPXTG-containing proteins to the listerial 
      surface. Here, we focus on the role of the second sortase, SrtB. Whereas SrtA acts 
      on most of the proteins in the peptidoglycan fraction, SrtB appears to target minor 
      amounts of surface polypeptides. We identified one of the SrtB-anchored proteins as 
      the virulence factor SvpA, a surface-exposed protein which does not contain the 
      LPXTG motif. Therefore, as in Staphylococcus aureus, the listerial SrtB represents a 
      second class of sortase in L. monocytogenes, involved in the attachment of a subset 
      of proteins to the cell wall, most likely by recognizing an NXZTN sorting motif. The 
      DeltasrtB mutant strain does not have defects in bacterial entry, growth, or 
      motility in tissue-cultured cells and does not show attenuated virulence in mice. 
      SrtB-mediated anchoring could therefore be required to anchor surface proteins 
      involved in the adaptation of this microorganism to different environmental 
      conditions.

AB  - In Gram-positive bacteria, Sortase A (Srt A) is a critical cysteine transpeptidase 
      that is responsible for recognizing and assembling surface virulence proteins 
      through the recognition of a LPXTG (leucine, proline, X, threonine, and glycine, 
      where X is any amino acid) signal. Mutants lacking genes for Srt A attenuate 
      infections without affecting microbial viability. Here a series of 
      2-phenyl-benzofuran-3-carboxamide derivatives were synthesized and identified as 
      potent Srt A inhibitors. Activity assays revealed that multiple compounds exhibited 
      excellent inhibitory activity against Srt A compared with known Sortase A inhibitor 
      pHMB (IC(50)=130μM). Structural activity relationships (SARs) demonstrated that the 
      amide group at 3-position was essential for inhibitory activity. Replacement of the 
      hydroxyl group at the 2-phenyl position of benzofuran with other substitutions such 
      as a methoxyl, halogen or nitro group reduced the enzyme inhibitory activity in most 
      cases. The compound Ia-22 was found to be the most potent inhibitor against the 
      enzyme with an IC(50) value of 30.8μM. Molecular docking studies showed Ia-22 shared 
      similar binding pattern with substrate LPXTG in the binding pocket of Srt A (PDB: 
      2KID) including i-butyl stretching, L-shape pattern kinking, and H-bond interaction 
      with Srt A functional site residues Cys184, Trp194 and Arg197.

TI  - Verification of sortase for protein conjugation by single-molecule force 
      spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations.

AB  - Sortase is one of the most widely used enzymes for covalent protein conjugation that 
      links protein and protein/small molecules together in a site-specific way. It 
      typically recognizes the "GGG" and "LPXTG" peptide sequences and conjugates them 
      into an "LPXTGGG" linker. As a non-natural linker with several flexible glycine 
      residues, it is unknown whether it affects the properties of the conjugated protein. 
      To verify the use of sortase for protein-protein conjugation, we combined 
      single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to 
      characterize sortase-conjugated polyprotein I27 with three different linkers. We 
      found that the I27 with classic linkers "LPETGGG" and "LPETG" from sortase ligation 
      were of normal stability. However, a protein with a longer artificial linker 
      "LPETGGGG" showed a 15% lower unfolding force. MD simulations revealed that the 4G 
      linker showed a high probability of a closed conformation, in which the adjacent 
      monomer has transient protein-protein interaction. Thus, we verify the use of 
      sortase for protein conjugation, and a longer linker with a higher glycine content 
      should be used with caution.

TI  - An exhaustive yet simple virtual screening campaign against Sortase A from multiple 
      drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 5167-75
LID - 10.1007/s11033-014-3384-2 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the challenging 
      bacterial pathogen due to its acquired resistance to the β lactam antibiotics. The 
      Sortase A is an enzyme of Gram-positive bacteria including S. aureus to anchor 
      surface proteins to the cell wall. Sortase A is well studied enzyme and considered 
      as the drug target against MRSA. Sortase A plays active role in anchoring the 
      virulence proteins on the cell wall of the Gram-positive bacteria. The inhibition of 
      Sortase A activity results in the separation of S. aureus from the host cells and 
      ultimately alleviation of the infection. Here, we adapted a structure-based virtual 
      screening protocol which helped in identification of novel potential inhibitors of 
      Sortase A. The protocol involved the docking of a chemical library of druglike 
      compounds with the Sortase A binding site represented by multiple crystal 
      structures. The compounds were ranked by multiple scoring functions and shortlisted 
      for future experimental screening. The method resulted in shortlisting of three 
      compounds as potential novel inhibitors of Sortase A out of a large chemical 
      library. The high rankings of shortlisted compounds estimated by multiple scoring 
      functions showed their binding potential with Sortase A. The results are proved to 
      be a simple yet efficient choice of structure-based virtual screening. The 
      identified compounds are druglike and show high rankings among all set protocols of 
      the virtual screening. We hope that the study would eventually help to expedite the 
      discovery of novel drug candidates against MRSA.

TI  - Crystal structures of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A and its substrate complex.
PG  - 31383-9
AB  - The cell wall envelope of staphylococci and other Gram-positive pathogens is coated 
      with surface proteins that interact with human host tissues. Surface proteins of 
      Staphylococcus aureus are covalently linked to the cell wall envelope by a mechanism 
      requiring C-terminal sorting signals with an LPXTG motif. Sortase (SrtA) cleaves 
      surface proteins between the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) of the LPXTG motif 
      and catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between threonine at the C-terminal end 
      of polypeptides and cell wall cross-bridges. The active site architecture and 
      catalytic mechanism of sortase A has hitherto not been revealed. Here we present the 
      crystal structures of native SrtA, of an active site mutant of SrtA, and of the 
      mutant SrtA complexed with its substrate LPETG peptide and describe the substrate 
      binding pocket of the enzyme. Highly conserved proline (P) and threonine (T) 
      residues of the LPXTG motif are held in position by hydrophobic contacts, whereas 
      the glutamic acid residue (E) at the X position points out into the solvent. The 
      scissile T-G peptide bond is positioned between the active site Cys(184) and 
      Arg(197) residues and at a greater distance from the imidazolium side chain of 
      His(120). All three residues, His(120), Cys(184), and Arg(197), are conserved in 
      sortase enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria. Comparison of the active sites of S. 
      aureus sortase A and sortase B provides insight into substrate specificity and 
      suggests a universal sortase-catalyzed mechanism of bacterial surface protein 
      anchoring in Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Investigation on the reaction conditions of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A for 
      creating surface-modified liposomes as a drug-delivery system tool.
PG  - 4521-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to determine the preferred conditions for the 
      transpeptidase reaction of sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus, for the purpose of 
      creating functional liposomes useful for a drug-delivery system (DDS). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: His-tagged recombinant sortase A with 59 amino acids deleted from the 
      N-terminus (His-ΔN59SrtA) was prepared using an Escherichia coli expression system. 
      The pH dependency and sorting signal sequence dependency of the transpeptidase 
      reaction of His-ΔN59SrtA were analyzed by monitoring the transfer of model 
      donor-substrates (i.e. His-tagged mutant green fluorescent proteins with a 
      C-terminal LPxTG sorting signal) to model acceptor-beads with a GGGGGC peptide. In 
      addition, using preferred conditions, the sortase A reaction was used to modify 
      liposome surface. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The transpeptidase reaction of 
      His-ΔN59SrtA was enhanced under weakly acidic conditions. Transfer efficiency, based 
      on sorting signal recognition by His-ΔN59SrtA, was similar to or higher than that 
      obtained using several substrates with amino acids other than Glu in the sorting 
      signal position "x". Furthermore, liposomes containing GGGGGC peptide-linked 
      dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine were successfully modified using the preferred 
      conditions for His-ΔN59SrtA determined in this study. CONCLUSION: Preferred 
      conditions for the transpeptidase reaction of His-ΔN59SrtA, especially in a weakly 
      acidic environment to enhance reaction, was established and successfully used to 
      create functional liposomes applicable to DDS.

LID - e27411
AB  - LPXTG proteins, present in most if not all Gram-positive bacteria, are known to be 
      anchored by sortases to the bacterial peptidoglycan. More than one sortase gene is 
      often encoded in a bacterial species, and each sortase is supposed to specifically 
      anchor given LPXTG proteins, depending of the sequence of the C-terminal cell wall 
      sorting signal (cwss), bearing an LPXTG motif or another recognition sequence. B. 
      anthracis possesses three sortase genes. B. anthracis sortase deleted mutant strains 
      are not affected in their virulence. To determine the sortase repertoires, we 
      developed a genetic screen using the property of the gamma phage to lyse bacteria 
      only when its receptor, GamR, an LPXTG protein, is exposed at the surface. We 
      identified 10 proteins that contain a cell wall sorting signal and are covalently 
      anchored to the peptidoglycan. Some chimeric proteins yielded phage lysis in all 
      sortase mutant strains, suggesting that cwss proteins remained surface accessible in 
      absence of their anchoring sortase, probably as a consequence of membrane 
      localization of yet uncleaved precursor proteins. For definite assignment of the 
      sortase repertoires, we consequently relied on a complementary test, using a 
      biochemical approach, namely immunoblot experiments. The sortase anchoring nine of 
      these proteins has thus been determined. The absence of virulence defect of the 
      sortase mutants could be a consequence of the membrane localization of the cwss 
      proteins.

TI  - Equilibrium of sortase A dimerization on Staphylococcus aureus cell surface mediates 
      its cell wall sorting activity.
PG  - 90-100
LID - 10.1177/1535370215592122 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) transpeptidase is a therapeutically important 
      membrane-bound enzyme in Gram-positive bacteria, which organizes the covalently 
      attached cell surface proteins on the peptidoglycan cell wall of the organism. Here, 
      we report the direct observation of the highly selective homo-dimerization of SrtA 
      on the cell membrane. To address the biological significance of the dimerization 
      towards enzyme function, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate a SrtA 
      mutant, which exists as monomer on the cell membrane. We observed that the cell 
      surface display of adhesive proteins in S. aureus cells expressing monomeric SrtA 
      mutant is more prominent than the cells expressing the wild-type enzyme. A 
      cell-based invasion assay was also performed to evaluate the activities of wild-type 
      SrtA and its monomeric mutant as well. Our data demonstrated that S. aureus cells 
      expressing SrtA in monomeric form invade host mammalian cells more efficiently than 
      those expressing wild-type SrtA in dimer-monomer equilibrium. The results suggested 
      that the monomeric form of SrtA is more active than the dimeric form of the enzyme 
      in terms of cell surface display of virulence factors for infection. This is the 
      first study to present the oligomerization of SrtA and its related biological 
      function on the cell membrane. Study of SrtA dimerization has implications for 
      understanding its catalytic mechanism at the cellular level as well as the 
      development of novel anti-infective agents.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A exists as a dimeric protein in vitro.
PG  - 9346-54
AB  - We report the first direct observation of the self-association behavior of the 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) transpeptidase. Formation of a SrtA dimer was 
      observed under native conditions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fast 
      protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Subsequent peptide mass fingerprinting and 
      protein sequencing experiments confirmed the dimeric form of the SrtA protein. 
      Furthermore, SrtA can be selectively cross-linked both in vitro and in Escherichia 
      coli. Multiple samples of enzyme were subjected to analytical sedimentation 
      equilibrium ultracentrifugation to obtain an apparent Kd for dimer formation of 
      about 55 microM. Finally, enzyme kinetic studies suggested that the dimeric form of 
      SrtA is more active than the monomeric enzyme. Discovery of SrtA dimerization may 
      have significant implications for understanding microbial physiology and developing 
      new antibiotics.

AB  - Chimeric proteins boast widespread use in areas ranging from cell biology to drug 
      delivery. Post-translational protein fusion using the bacterial transpeptidase 
      sortase A provides an attractive alternative when traditional gene fusion fails. We 
      describe use of this enzyme for in vitro protein ligation and report the successful 
      fusion of 10 pairs of protein domains with preserved functionality--demonstrating 
      the robust and facile nature of this reaction.

TI  - Rapid addition of unlabeled silent solubility tags to proteins using a new 
      substrate-fused sortase reagent.
PG  - 197-205
LID - 10.1007/s10858-016-0019-z [doi]
AB  - Many proteins can't be studied using solution NMR methods because they have limited 
      solubility. To overcome this problem, recalcitrant proteins can be fused to a more 
      soluble protein that functions as a solubility tag. However, signals arising from 
      the solubility tag hinder data analysis because they increase spectral complexity. 
      We report a new method to rapidly and efficiently add a non-isotopically labeled 
      Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier protein (SUMO) solubility tag to an isotopically 
      labeled protein. The method makes use of a newly developed SUMO-Sortase tagging 
      reagent in which SUMO and the Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme are present within the same 
      polypeptide. The SUMO-Sortase reagent rapidly attaches SUMO to any protein that 
      contains the sequence LPXTG at its C-terminus. It modifies proteins at least 
      15-times faster than previously described approaches, and does not require active 
      dialysis or centrifugation during the reaction to increase product yields. In 
      addition, silently tagged proteins are readily purified using the well-established 
      SUMO expression and purification system. The utility of the SUMO-Sortase tagging 
      reagent is demonstrated using PhoP and green fluorescent proteins, which are ~90% 
      modified with SUMO at room temperature within four hours. SrtA is widely used as a 
      tool to construct bioconjugates. Significant rate enhancements in these procedures 
      may also be achieved by fusing the sortase enzyme to its nucleophile substrate.

TI  - Sortase A contributes to pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in the chinchilla 
      model.
PG  - 151-4
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is required to anchor neuraminidase, beta-galactosidase, and 
      possibly other LPXTG motif proteins to the pneumococcal cell surface. We examined 
      the role of SrtA in Streptococcus pneumoniae nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization in the 
      chinchilla model. The srtA mutant colonized the nasopharynx at a significantly lower 
      level than the D39 parent strain during the second and third week of the carriage, 
      and was eliminated from nasopharynx one week earlier than the D39 pneumococci. Our 
      data indicate that SrtA contributes to pneumococcal NP colonization in this animal 
      model.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms of the sortase A gene and early childhood caries in 
      two-year-old children.
PG  - 948-53
LID - 10.1016/j.archoralbio.2012.02.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore and compare the genetic polymorphisms of the sortase A (srtA) 
      gene found in Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) infecting two-year-old children 
      suffering early childhood caries to those found in caries-free children through 
      molecular identification methods. METHODS: Clinical S. mutans strains were isolated 
      from the dental plaques of two-year-old children. Fifteen strains of S. mutans from 
      the caries-active group and 15 strains of S. mutans from the caries-free group were 
      collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from the S. mutans isolates. DNA fragments, 
      including the srtA gene, were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were purified, 
      sequenced and analyzed. A chi-square test and BioEdit software were used to analyze 
      the sequencing results. RESULTS: All 30 clinically isolated S. mutans strains had a 
      741 base pair (bp) srtA gene. There were no nucleotide sequence insertions or 
      deletions observed in the srtA genes. Twenty mutations were identified in the srtA 
      genes that taken from the 30 clinical strains. There were 10 silent point mutations 
      at the 78, 99, 150, 165, 186, 222, 249, 261, 312, and 636bp positions. The other 10 
      mutations were point mutations resulting in a missense mutation at the 23, 34, 36, 
      47, 112, 114, 168, 176, 470, and 671bp positions. None of the positions were 
      enzyme-activity sites of srt A. The missense mutation rates of the two groups did 
      not exhibit statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: There were no genetic 
      polymorphisms of the sortase A gene associated with early childhood caries in 
      two-year-old children.

TI  - Depsipeptide substrates for sortase-mediated N-terminal protein ligation.
PG  - 253-62
LID - 10.1038/nprot.2014.003 [doi]
AB  - Technologies that allow the efficient chemical modification of proteins under mild 
      conditions are widely sought after. Sortase-mediated peptide ligation provides a 
      strategy for modifying the N or C terminus of proteins. This protocol describes the 
      use of depsipeptide substrates (containing an ester linkage) with sortase A (SrtA) 
      to completely modify proteins carrying a single N-terminal glycine residue under 
      mild conditions in 4-6 h. The SrtA-mediated ligation reaction is reversible, so most 
      labeling protocols that use this enzyme require a large excess of both substrate and 
      sortase to produce high yields of ligation product. In contrast, switching to 
      depsipeptide substrates effectively renders the reaction irreversible, allowing 
      complete labeling of proteins with a small excess of substrate and catalytic 
      quantities of sortase. Herein we describe the synthesis of depsipeptide substrates 
      that contain an ester linkage between a threonine and glycolic acid residue and an 
      N-terminal FITC fluorophore appended via a thiourea linkage. The synthesis of the 
      depsipeptide substrate typically takes 2-3 d.

TI  - Discovery of a 29-Amino-Acid Reactive Abiotic Peptide for Selective Cysteine 
      Arylation.
PG  - 527-532
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.7b00520 [doi]
AB  - The regio- and chemoselective modification of proteins or peptides with chemical 
      reagents is often challenging. One approach to overcome this problem involves 
      identifying abiotic polypeptide sequences that react with specific small molecules. 
      Toward this goal, we profiled ∼5 × 10(13) randomized 30-mer peptides using mRNA 
      display and high-throughput sequencing in search of polypeptides that can undergo 
      cysteine arylation with a water-soluble perfluoroarene. Within this vast chemical 
      space, we discovered a cysteine-containing sequence with a second-order rate 
      constant of 0.29 M(-1) s(-1) for arylation. An N- and C-terminal truncation reduced 
      the reaction rate, as did the addition of denaturants. When the reactive peptide was 
      covalently fused to the enzyme Sortase A, we observed regiospecific arylation at a 
      single cysteine site, leaving the enzyme's active site cysteine unchanged. Taken 
      together, these results demonstrate that long polypeptides of defined sequence, when 
      matched with the appropriate reactive group, can be used for selective arylation of 
      cysteine in water.

TI  - Anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus. A conserved 
      arginine residue is required for efficient catalysis of sortase A.
PG  - 37763-70
AB  - Surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus are anchored to the cell wall envelope by 
      a mechanism requiring a C-terminal sorting signal with an LPXTG motif. Sortase A 
      cleaves surface proteins between the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) residues of 
      the LPXTG motif and catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl 
      group of threonine at the C-terminal end of polypeptides and the amino group of 
      pentaglycine cross-bridges of cell wall peptidoglycan. Previous work showed that 
      Cys(184) and His(120) of sortase A are absolutely essential for catalysis; however 
      an active site thiolateimidazolium ion pair may not be formed. The three-dimensional 
      crystal structure of sortase A revealed that Arg(197) is located in close proximity 
      to both the active site Cys(184) and the scissile peptide bond between threonine and 
      glycine. We show here that substitution of Arg(197) with alanine, lysine, or 
      histidine severely reduced sortase A function both in vivo and in vitro, whereas 
      Asn(98), which had earlier been implicated in hydrogen bonding to His(120), was 
      found to be dispensable for catalysis. As the structural proximity of Arg(197) and 
      Cys(184) is conserved in sortase enzymes and as ionization of the Cys(184) 
      sulfhydryl group seems required for sortase activity, we propose that Arg(197) may 
      function as a base, facilitating thiolate formation during sortase-mediated cleavage 
      and transpeptidation reactions.

TI  - The sortase A substrates FnbpA, FnbpB, ClfA and ClfB antagonize colony spreading of 
      Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - e44646

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that is renowned both for its 
      rapid transmission within hospitals and the community, and for the formation of 
      antibiotic resistant biofilms on medical implants. Recently, it was shown that S. 
      aureus is able to spread over wet surfaces. This motility phenomenon is promoted by 
      the surfactant properties of secreted phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), which are also 
      known to inhibit biofilm formation. The aim of the present studies was to determine 
      whether any cell surface-associated S. aureus proteins have an impact on colony 
      spreading. To this end, we analyzed the spreading capabilities of strains lacking 
      non-essential components of the protein export and sorting machinery. Interestingly, 
      our analyses reveal that the absence of sortase A (SrtA) causes a hyper-spreading 
      phenotype. SrtA is responsible for covalent anchoring of various proteins to the 
      staphylococcal cell wall. Accordingly, we show that the hyper-spreading phenotype of 
      srtA mutant cells is an indirect effect that relates to the sortase substrates 
      FnbpA, FnbpB, ClfA and ClfB. These surface-exposed staphylococcal proteins are known 
      to promote biofilm formation, and cell-cell interactions. The hyper-spreading 
      phenotype of srtA mutant staphylococcal cells was subsequently validated in 
      Staphylococcus epidermidis. We conclude that cell wall-associated factors that 
      promote a sessile lifestyle of S. aureus and S. epidermidis antagonize the colony 
      spreading motility of these bacteria.

AB  - Surface immobilization of bioactive molecules is a central paradigm in the design of 
      implantable devices and biosensors with improved clinical performance capabilities. 
      However, in vivo degradation or denaturation of surface constituents often limits 
      the long-term performance of bioactive films. Here we demonstrate the capacity to 
      repeatedly regenerate a covalently immobilized monomolecular thin film of bioactive 
      molecules through a two-step stripping and recharging cycle. Reversible 
      transpeptidation by a laboratory evolved Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (eSrtA) 
      enabled the rapid immobilization of an anti-thrombogenic film in the presence of 
      whole blood and permitted multiple cycles of film regeneration in vitro that 
      preserved its biological activity. Moreover, eSrtA transpeptidation facilitated 
      surface re-engineering of medical devices in situ after in vivo implantation through 
      removal and restoration film constituents. These studies establish a rapid, 
      orthogonal and reversible biochemical scheme to regenerate selective molecular 
      constituents with the potential to extend the lifetime of bioactive films.

TI  - A Versatile Chemo-Enzymatic Conjugation Approach Yields Homogeneous and Highly 
      Potent Antibody-Drug Conjugates.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18112284 [doi]
LID - 2284
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy of antibodies can be successfully improved through targeted 
      delivery of potent cytotoxic drugs in the form of antibody-drug conjugates. However, 
      conventional conjugation strategies lead to heterogeneous conjugates with undefined 
      stoichiometry and sites, even with considerable batch-to-batch variability. In this 
      study, we have developed a chemo-enzymatic strategy by equipping the C-terminus of 
      anti-CD20 ofatumumab with a click handle using Sortase A, followed by ligation of 
      the payload based on a strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition to produce 
      homogeneous conjugates. The resulting antibody-drug conjugates fully retained their 
      antigen binding capability and proved to be internalized and trafficked to the 
      lysosome, which released the payload with a favorable efficacy in vitro and in vivo. 
      Thus, this reported method is a versatile tool with maximum flexibility for 
      development of antibody-drug conjugates and protein modification.

TI  - Sortase-catalyzed in vitro functionalization of a HER2-specific recombinant Fab for 
      tumor targeting of the plant cytotoxin gelonin.
PG  - 354-66
LID - 10.4161/mabs.27444 [doi]
AB  - We report on the preparation of a new type of immunotoxin via in vitro ligation of 
      the αHer2 antigen binding fragment (Fab) of the clinically-validated antibody 
      trastuzumab to the plant toxin gelonin, employing catalysis by the bacterial enzyme 
      sortase A (SrtA). The αHer2 Fab was fused with the extended SrtA recognition motif 
      LPET↓GLEH 6 at the C-terminus of its heavy chain, thereby preventing interference 
      with antigen binding, while the toxin was equipped with a Gly 2 sequence at its 
      N-terminus, distant to the catalytically active site in the C-terminal region. 
      Site-specific in vitro transpeptidation led to a novel antibody-toxin conjugate 
      wherein gelonin had effectively replaced the Fc region of a conventional 
      (monomerized) immunoglobulin. After optimization of reaction conditions and 
      incubation time, the resulting Fab-Gelonin ligation product was purified to 
      homogeneity in a two-step procedure by means of Strep-Tactin affinity 
      chromatography--utilizing the Strep-tag II appended to gelonin--and size exclusion 
      chromatography. Binding activity of the immunotoxin for the Her2 ectodomain was 
      indistinguishable from the unligated Fab as measured by real-time surface plasmon 
      resonance spectroscopy. Specific cytotoxic potency of Fab-Gelonin was demonstrated 
      against two Her2-positive cell lines, resulting in EC 50 values of ~1 nM or lower, 
      indicating a 1000-fold enhanced cell-killing activity compared with gelonin itself. 
      Thus, our strategy provides a convenient route to the modular construction of 
      functional immunotoxins from Fabs of established tumor-specific antibodies with 
      gelonin or related proteotoxins, also avoiding the elevated biosafety levels that 
      would be mandatory for the direct biotechnological preparation of corresponding 
      fusion proteins.

TI  - Aaptamines as sortase A inhibitors from the tropical sponge Aaptos aaptos.
PG  - 5366-9
AB  - Four aaptamines (1-4), 1H-benzo[de][1,6]-naphthyridine alkaloids, were isolated from 
      the marine sponge Aaptos aaptos and their inhibitory activities against sortase A 
      (SrtA), an enzyme that plays a key role in cell wall protein anchoring and virulence 
      in Staphylococcus aureus, were evaluated. Isoaaptamine (2) was a potent inhibitor of 
      SrtA, with an IC(50) value of 3.7+/-0.2 microg/mL. The suppression of 
      fibronectin-binding activity by isoaaptamine (2) highlights its potential for the 
      treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of SrtA activity. Our studies have 
      identified a series of SrtA inhibitors, providing the basis for further development 
      of potent inhibitors.

TI  - Sortase-mediated protein ligation: a new method for protein engineering.
PG  - 2670-1
AB  - Sortase (SrtA), a transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus, catalyzes a cell-wall 
      sorting reaction at an LPXTG motif by cleaving between threonine and glycine and 
      subsequently joining the carboxyl group of threonine to an amino group of 
      pentaglycine on the cell wall peptidoglycan. We have applied this transpeptidyl 
      activity of sortase to in vitro protein ligation. We found that in the presence of 
      sortase, protein/peptide with an LPXTG motif can be specifically ligated to an 
      aminoglycine protein/peptide via an amide bond. Additionally, sortase can even 
      conjugate substrates such as (d)-peptides, synthetic branched peptides, and 
      aminoglycine-derivatized small molecules to the C terminus of a recombinant protein. 
      The sortase-mediate protein ligation is robust, specific, and easy to perform, and 
      can be widely applied to specific protein conjugation with polypeptides or molecules 
      of unique biochemical and biophysical properties.

TI  - Sortaggable liposomes: Evaluation of reaction conditions for single-domain antibody 
      conjugation by Sortase-A and targeting of CD11b(+) myeloid cells.

LID - S0939-6411(18)30630-1 [pii]

AB  - Active targeting with ligand coated liposomal drug delivery systems is a means to 
      increase the therapeutic index of drugs. Stable ligand coating requires bilayer 
      anchorage of the commonly proteinaceous ligands and hence a conjugation of lipid 
      structures towards amino acids. This often leads to heterogeneous reaction products 
      especially when chemical coupling methods are employed. Chemoenzymatic Sortase-A 
      mediated transpeptidation (sortagging) is a useful tool to avoid this protein 
      heterogeneity through its site-specific, bioorthogonal ligation mechanism. 
      Manufacturing of such sortaggable, pentaglycine modified liposomes was developed by 
      adaption of a scalable solvent injection technique. The pentaglycine liposomes were 
      prepared with different degrees of PEGylation and steric accessibility of the 
      pentaglycine motif. Comparable hydrodynamic diameters (146-188 nm) of the different 
      formulations were obtained after a flow rate screening. The sortagging reactivity of 
      a single-domain antibody (VHH) towards the pentaglycine liposomes was strongly 
      dependent on the steric accessibility of the pentaglycine nucleophile. Adjusting the 
      pentaglycine to ligand ratio improved conversion rates up to 80%. The liposome bound 
      VHH was accessible for its soluble antigen as shown by a chromatography-based 
      binding assay. Mono- and granulocytes could be selectively targeted in vitro by 
      conjugation of BMX1, a VHH directed towards human myeloid cell surface marker CD11b. 
      Confocal microscopy revealed intracellular localization of the targeted liposomes. 
      The developability of those pentaglycine liposomes as well as their proof of 
      principle for targeted drug delivery shows their potential for further 
      investigation, for example as delivery platform for diagnostics or drugs into the 
      tumor microenvironment.

AB  - Sortases are a class of bacterial enzymes that possess transpeptidase activity. It 
      is their ability to site-specifically break a peptide bond and then reform a new 
      bond with an incoming nucleophile that makes sortase an attractive tool for protein 
      engineering. This technique has been adopted for a range of applications, from 
      chemistry-based to cell biology and technology. In this Minireview we provide a 
      brief overview of the biology of sortase enzymes and current applications in protein 
      engineering. We identify areas that lend themselves to further innovation and that 
      suggest new applications.

TI  - A novel bacterial resistance mechanism against human group IIA-secreted 
      phospholipase A2: role of Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A.
PG  - 6437-46
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1100499 [doi]
AB  - Human group IIA-secreted phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IIA) is a bactericidal molecule 
      important for the innate immune defense against Gram-positive bacteria. In this 
      study, we analyzed its role in the host defense against Streptococcus pyogenes, a 
      major human pathogen, and demonstrated that this bacterium has evolved a previously 
      unidentified mechanism to resist killing by sPLA(2)-IIA. Analysis of a set of 
      clinical isolates demonstrated that an ~500-fold higher concentration of sPLA(2)-IIA 
      was required to kill S. pyogenes compared with strains of the group B Streptococcus, 
      which previously were shown to be sensitive to sPLA(2)-IIA, indicating that S. 
      pyogenes exhibits a high degree of resistance to sPLA(2)-IIA. We found that an S. 
      pyogenes mutant lacking sortase A, a transpeptidase responsible for anchoring LPXTG 
      proteins to the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria, was significantly more 
      sensitive (~30-fold) to sPLA(2)-IIA compared with the parental strain, indicating 
      that one or more LPXTG surface proteins protect S. pyogenes against sPLA(2)-IIA. 
      Importantly, using transgenic mice expressing human sPLA(2)-IIA, we showed that the 
      sortase A-mediated sPLA(2)-IIA resistance mechanism in S. pyogenes also occurs in 
      vivo. Moreover, in this mouse model, we also showed that human sPLA(2)-IIA is 
      important for the defense against lethal S. pyogenes infection. Thus, we 
      demonstrated a novel mechanism by which a pathogenic bacterium can evade the 
      bactericidal action of sPLA(2)-IIA and we showed that sPLA(2)-IIA contributes to the 
      host defense against S. pyogenes infection.

TI  - Structure of the Bacillus anthracis Sortase A Enzyme Bound to Its Sorting Signal: A 
      FLEXIBLE AMINO-TERMINAL APPENDAGE MODULATES SUBSTRATE ACCESS.
PG  - 25461-74
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.670984 [doi]
AB  - The endospore forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis causes lethal anthrax disease in 
      humans and animals. The ability of this pathogen to replicate within macrophages is 
      dependent upon the display of bacterial surface proteins attached to the cell wall 
      by the B. anthracis Sortase A ((Ba)SrtA) enzyme. Previously, we discovered that the 
      class A (Ba)SrtA sortase contains a unique N-terminal appendage that wraps around 
      the body of the protein to contact the active site of the enzyme. To gain insight 
      into its function, we determined the NMR structure of (Ba)SrtA bound to a LPXTG 
      sorting signal analog. The structure, combined with dynamics, kinetics, and whole 
      cell protein display data suggest that the N terminus modulates substrate access to 
      the enzyme. We propose that it may increase the efficiency of protein display by 
      reducing the unproductive hydrolytic cleavage of enzyme-protein covalent 
      intermediates that form during the cell wall anchoring reaction. Notably, a key 
      active site loop (β7/β8 loop) undergoes a disordered to ordered transition upon 
      binding the sorting signal, potentially facilitating recognition of lipid II.

TI  - A self-cleavable sortase fusion for one-step purification of free recombinant 
      proteins.
PG  - 253-63
AB  - A new protein fusion system has been developed to generate free recombinant protein 
      in a single affinity chromatographic step. The key component in the fusion is the 
      catalytic core of sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus (SrtAc), which recognizes and 
      cleaves the Thr-Gly bond at an LPXTG sequence with moderate activity. The fusion 
      here consists of an N-terminal His6 tag, SrtAc, and an LPETG linker followed by 
      protein of interest at the C-terminus. The fusion protein is expressed in 
      Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography 
      (IMAC). The immobilized fusion then undergoes on-column SrtAc-mediated cleavage at 
      the LPETG site in the presence of Ca2+ and/or triglycine. The target protein with an 
      extra N-terminal glycine is released from the fusion while the N-terminal portion 
      remains bound to the column. Because the cleavage enzyme SrtAc is co-expressed as a 
      fusion with the target protein, the purification system eliminates exogenous 
      proteolysis. This purification approach is simple, robust, inexpensive, time saving, 
      and allows purification of free recombinant protein via one-step chromatography.

TI  - Site-specific protein modification using immobilized sortase in batch and 
      continuous-flow systems.
PG  - 508-16
LID - 10.1038/nprot.2015.026 [doi]
AB  - Transpeptidation catalyzed by sortase A allows the preparation of proteins that are 
      site-specifically and homogeneously modified with a wide variety of functional 
      groups, such as fluorophores, PEG moieties, lipids, glycans, bio-orthogonal reactive 
      groups and affinity handles. This protocol describes immobilization of sortase A on 
      a solid support (Sepharose beads). Immobilization of sortase A simplifies downstream 
      purification of a protein of interest after labeling of its N or C terminus. Smaller 
      batch and larger-scale continuous-flow reactions require only a limited amount of 
      enzyme. The immobilized enzyme can be reused for multiple cycles of protein 
      modification reactions. The described protocol also works with a Ca(2+)-independent 
      variant of sortase A with increased catalytic activity. This heptamutant variant of 
      sortase A (7M) was generated by combining previously published mutations, and this 
      immobilized enzyme can be used for the modification of calcium-senstive substrates 
      or in instances in which low temperatures are needed. Preparation of immobilized 
      sortase A takes 1-2 d. Batch reactions take 3-12 h and flow reactions proceed at 0.5 
      ml h(-1), depending on the geometry of the reactor used.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) is an enzyme that anchors proteins to the 
      cell surface of Gram-positive bacteria. During the transpeptidation reaction 
      performed by SaSrtA, proteins containing an N-terminal glycine can be covalently 
      linked to another protein with a C-terminal LPXTG motif (X being any amino acid). 
      Since the sortase reaction can be performed in vitro as well, it has found many 
      applications in biotechnology. Although sortase-mediated ligation has many 
      advantages, SaSrtA is limited by its low enzymatic activity and dependence on Ca2+. 
      In our study, we evaluated the thermodynamic stability of the SaSrtA wild type and 
      found the enzyme to be stable. We applied consensus analysis to further improve the 
      enzyme's stability while at the same time enhancing the enzyme's activity. As a 
      result, we found thermodynamically improved, more active and Ca2+-independent 
      mutants. We envision that these new variants can be applied in conjugation reactions 
      in low Ca2+ environments.

AB  - A series of novel 2-phenyl-benzo[d]oxazole-7-carboxamide derivatives were designed, 
      synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory activities against 
      Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A with known Sortase A inhibitor pHMB as positive 
      compound (IC50=130μM). Most compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activity 
      (IC50=19.8-184.2μM). Structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that 
      substitution at 7-position and 2-position of benzoxazole had great influence on the 
      activities. Specifically, the substituent at 7-position is indispensable for 
      inhibitory activity. The molecular docking studies revealed the i-butyl amide group 
      went towards the β6/β7 loop-β8 substructure of the protein and the benzoxazole core 
      lied in a hydrophobic pocket composed of Ala118, Val166, Val168, Val169 and Ile182, 
      shaping the whole molecule into a L-shape mode to be recognized by Sortase A.

TI  - Discovery of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A inhibitors using virtual screening and 
      the relaxed complex scheme.
PG  - 418-28
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.12167 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections in the 
      United States. The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus has created 
      an urgent need for new antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus uses the sortase A enzyme 
      to display surface virulence factors suggesting that compounds that inhibit its 
      activity will function as potent anti-infective agents. Here, we report the 
      identification of several inhibitors of sortase A using virtual screening methods 
      that employ the relaxed complex scheme, an advanced computer-docking methodology 
      that accounts for protein receptor flexibility. Experimental testing validates that 
      several compounds identified in the screen inhibit the activity of sortase A. A lead 
      compound based on the 2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-perimidine scaffold is particularly 
      promising, and its binding mechanism was further investigated using molecular 
      dynamics simulations and conducting preliminary structure-activity relationship 
      studies.

TI  - Role of Streptococcus sanguinis sortase A in bacterial colonization.
PG  - 2791-6
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis, a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity, has low 
      cariogenicity, though colonization on tooth surfaces by this bacterium initiates 
      aggregation by other oral bacteria and maturation of dental plaque. Additionally, S. 
      sanguinis is frequently isolated from infective endocarditis patients. We 
      investigated the functions of sortase A (SrtA), which cleaves LPXTG-containing 
      proteins and anchors them to the bacterial cell wall, as a possible virulence factor 
      of S. sanguinis. We identified the srtA gene of S. sanguinis by searching a 
      homologous gene of Streptococcus mutans in genome databases. Next, we constructed an 
      srtA-deficient mutant strain of S. sanguinis by insertional inactivation and 
      compared it to the wild type strain. In the case of the mutant strain, some surface 
      proteins could not anchor to the cell wall and were partially released into the 
      culture supernatant. Furthermore, adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads 
      and polystyrene plates, as well as adherence to and invasion of human epithelial 
      cells were reduced significantly in the srtA-deficient strain when compared to the 
      wild type. In addition, antiopsonization levels and bacterial survival of the 
      srtA-deficient mutant were decreased in human whole blood. This is the first known 
      study to report that SrtA contributes to antiopsonization in streptococci. Our 
      results suggest that SrtA anchors surface adhesins as well as some proteins that 
      function as antiopsonic molecules as a means of evading the human immune system. 
      Furthermore, they demonstrate that SrtA of S. sanguinis plays important roles in 
      bacterial colonization.

      catalytic mechanism.
PG  - 1564-72
LID - 10.1002/prot.22983 [doi]
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is one of the most virulent foodborne pathogens. L. 
      monocytogenes Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme, which catalyzes the cell wall anchoring 
      reaction of the leucine, proline, X, threonine, and glycine proteins (LPXTG, where X 
      is any amino acid), is a target for the development of antilisteriosis drugs. In 
      this study, the structure of the L. monocytogenes SrtA enzyme-substrate complex was 
      obtained using homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
      simulations. Explicit enzyme-substrate interactions in the inactive and active forms 
      of the enzyme were compared, based on 30 ns simulations on each system. The active 
      site arginine (Arg 197) was found to be able change its hydrogen donor interactions 
      from the LP backbone carbonyl groups of the LPXTG substrate in the inactive form, to 
      the TG backbone carbonyls in the active form, which could be of importance for 
      holding the substrate in position for the catalytic process.

TI  - The role of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A and sortase B in murine arthritis.
PG  - 775-80
AB  - Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria display proteins on their surface that play 
      important roles during infection. In Staphylococcus aureus, these surface proteins 
      are anchored to the cell wall by two sortase enzymes, SrtA and SrtB, that recognize 
      specific surface protein sorting signals. The role of sortase enzymes in bacterial 
      virulence was examined using a murine septic arthritis model. Intravenous 
      inoculation with any of the Delta(srtA), Delta(srtB) or Delta(srtAB) mutants 
      resulted in significantly increased survival and significantly lower weight loss 
      compared with the parental strain. Mice inoculated with the Delta(srtA) mutant did 
      not express severe arthritis, while arthritis in mice inoculated with the 
      Delta(srtB) mutant was not different from that seen in mice that were infected with 
      the wild-type parent strain. Furthermore, persistence of staphylococci in kidneys 
      and joints following intravenous inoculation of mice was more pronounced for 
      wild-type and Delta(srtB) mutant strains than for Delta(srtA) or Delta(srtAB) 
      variants. Together these results indicate that sortase B (srtB) plays a contributing 
      role during the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections, whereas sortase A (srtA) 
      is an essential virulence factor for the establishment of septic arthritis.

      sortase A.

LID - 10.1038/ijos.2016.58 [doi]
AB  - Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases and is caused by acid 
      fermentation of bacteria adhered to the teeth. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) 
      utilizes sortase A (SrtA) to anchor surface proteins to the cell wall and forms a 
      biofilm to facilitate its adhesion to the tooth surface. Some plant natural 
      products, especially several flavonoids, are effective inhibitors of SrtA. However, 
      given the limited number of inhibitors and the development of drug resistance, the 
      discovery of new inhibitors is urgent. Here, the high-throughput virtual screening 
      approach was performed to identify new potential inhibitors of S. mutans SrtA. Two 
      libraries were used for screening, and nine compounds that had the lowest scores 
      were chosen for further molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy analysis 
      and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties 
      analysis. The results revealed that several similar compounds composed of 
      benzofuran, thiadiazole and pyrrole, which exhibited good affinities and appropriate 
      pharmacokinetic parameters, were potential inhibitors to impede the catalysis of 
      SrtA. In addition, the carbonyl of these compounds can have a key role in the 
      inhibition mechanism. These findings can provide a new strategy for microbial 
      infection disease therapy.

TI  - Contribution of autolysin and Sortase a during Enterococcus faecalis DNA-dependent 
      biofilm development.
PG  - 3626-38
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00219-09 [doi]
AB  - Biofilm production is a major attribute of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolates. 
      Although some factors, such as sortases, autolysin, and extracellular DNA (eDNA), 
      have been associated with E. faecalis biofilm production, the mechanisms underlying 
      the contributions of these factors to this process have not been completely 
      elucidated yet. In this study we define important roles for the major E. faecalis 
      autolysin (Atn), eDNA, and sortase A (SrtA) during the developmental stages of 
      biofilm formation under static and hydrodynamic conditions. Deletion of srtA affects 
      the attachment stage and results in a deficiency in biofilm production. 
      Atn-deficient mutants are delayed in biofilm development due to defects in primary 
      adherence and DNA release, which we show to be particularly important during the 
      accumulative phase for maturation and architectural stability of biofilms. Confocal 
      laser scanning and freeze-dry electron microscopy of biofilms grown under 
      hydrodynamic conditions revealed that E. faecalis produces a DNase I-sensitive 
      fibrous network, which is important for biofilm stability and is absent in 
      atn-deficient mutant biofilms. This study establishes the stage-specific 
      requirements for SrtA and Atn and demonstrates a role for Atn in the pathway leading 
      to DNA release during biofilm development in E. faecalis.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A contributes to the Trojan horse mechanism of immune 
      defense evasion with its intrinsic resistance to Cys184 oxidation.
PG  - 7591-9
LID - 10.1021/bi200844h [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes serious 
      infections which have become increasingly difficult to treat due to antimicrobial 
      resistance and natural virulence strategies. Bacterial sortase enzymes are important 
      virulence factors and good targets for future antibiotic development. It has 
      recently been shown that sortase enzymes are integral to bacterial survival of 
      phagocytosis, an underappreciated, but vital, step in S. aureus pathogenesis. Of 
      note, the reaction mechanism of sortases relies on a solvent-accessible cysteine for 
      transpeptidation. Because of the common strategy of oxidative damage employed by 
      professional phagocytes to kill pathogens, it is possible that this cysteine may be 
      oxidized inside the phagosome, thereby inhibiting the enzyme. This study addresses 
      this apparent paradox by assessing the ability of physiological reactive oxygen 
      species, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite, to inhibit sortase A (SrtA) from S. 
      aureus. Surprisingly, we found that SrtA is highly resistant to oxidative 
      inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of resistance to oxidative 
      damage is likely mediated by maintaining a high reduction potential of the catalytic 
      cysteine residue, Cys184. This is due to the unusual active site utilized by S. 
      aureus SrtA, which employs a reverse protonation mechanism for transpeptidation, 
      resulting in a high pK(a) as well as reduction potential for Cys184. The results of 
      this study suggest that S. aureus SrtA is able to withstand the extreme conditions 
      encountered in the phagosome and maintain function, contributing to survival of 
      phagocytotic killing.

AB  - Increasing interest in protein immobilization on surfaces has heightened the need 
      for techniques enabling layer-by-layer protein attachment. Here, we report a 
      technique for controlling enzyme-mediated immobilization of layers of protein on the 
      surface using a genetically encoded protecting group. An enterokinase-cleavable 
      peptide sequence was inserted at the N-terminus of bifunctional fluorescent proteins 
      containing Sortase A substrate recognition tags at both ends to control Sortase 
      A-mediated protein immobilization on the surface layer-by-layer. Efficient, 
      sequential immobilization of a second layer of protein using Sortase A required 
      removal of the N-terminal protecting group, suggesting the method enables multilayer 
      synthesis using cyclic deprotection and coupling steps. © 2017 American Institute of

LID - 10.1128/IAI.03122-14 [doi]
AB  - The immunoglobulin binding protein A (SpA) of Staphylococcus aureus is synthesized 
      as a precursor with a C-terminal sorting signal. The sortase A enzyme mediates 
      covalent attachment to peptidoglycan so that SpA is displayed on the surface of the 
      bacterium. Protein A is also found in the extracellular medium, but the processes 
      involved in its release are not fully understood. Here, we show that a portion of 
      SpA is released into the supernatant with an intact sorting signal, indicating that 
      it has not been processed by sortase A. Release of SpA was reduced when the native 
      sorting signal of SpA was replaced with the corresponding region of another 
      sortase-anchored protein (SdrE). Similarly, a reporter protein fused to the sorting 
      signal of SpA was released to a greater extent than the same polypeptide fused to 
      the SdrE sorting signal. Released SpA protected bacteria from killing in human 
      blood, indicating that it contributes to immune evasion.

TI  - Curcuma longa L. constituents inhibit sortase A and Staphylococcus aureus cell 
      adhesion to fibronectin.
PG  - 9005-9
AB  - The inhibitory activity of Curcuma longa L. (turmeric) rhizome constituents against 
      sortase A, a bacterial surface protein anchoring transpeptidase, from Staphylococcus 
      aureus ATCC 6538p was evaluated. The activity of the isolated compounds (1-4) was 
      compared to that of the positive control,p-hydroxymecuribenzoic acid (pHMB). The 
      biologically active components of C. longa rhizome were characterized by 
      spectroscopic analysis as the curcuminoids curcumin (1), demethoxycurcumin (2), and 
      bisdemethoxycurcumin (3). Curcumin was a potent inhibitor of sortase A, with an IC50 
      value of 13.8 +/- 0.7 microg/mL. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (IC50 = 31.9 +/- 1.2 
      microg/mL) and demethoxycurcumin (IC50 = 23.8 +/- 0.6 microg/mL) were more effective 
      than pHMB (IC50 = 40.6 +/- 1.2 microg/mL). The three isolated compounds (1-3) showed 
      no growth inhibitory activity against S. aureus strain Newman, with minimum 
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) greater than 200 microg/mL. Curcumin also exhibited 
      potent inhibitory activity against S. aureus cell adhesion to fibronectin. The 
      suppression of fibronectin-binding activity by curcumin highlights its potential for 
      the treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of sortase activity. These 
      results indicate that curcumin is a possible candidate in the development of a 
      bacterial sortase A inhibitor.

AB  - The catalytic activity of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SaSrtA) is dependent on 
      Ca(2+), because binding of Ca(2+) to Glu residues distal to the active site 
      stabilizes the substrate binding site. To obtain Ca(2+)-independent SaSrtA, we 
      substituted two Glu residues in the Ca(2+)-binding pocket (Glu(105) and Glu(108)). 
      Although single mutations decreased SaSrtA activity, mutations of both Glu(105) and 
      Glu(108) resulted in Ca(2+)-independent activity. Kinetic analysis suggested that 
      the double mutations affect the substrate binding site, without affecting substrate 
      specificity. This approach will allow us to develop SaSrtA variants suitable for 
      various applications, including in vivo site-specific protein modification and 
      labeling.

TI  - Sortase-catalysed anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of Staphylococcus 
      aureus.
PG  - 1049-57
AB  - Many surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria are anchored to the cell wall 
      envelope by a transpeptidation mechanism, requiring a C-terminal sorting signal with 
      a conserved LPXTG motif. Sortase, a membrane protein of Staphylococcus aureus, 
      cleaves polypeptides between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif and 
      catalyses the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl-group of threonine and 
      the amino-group of peptidoglycan cross-bridges. S. aureus mutants lacking the srtA 
      gene fail to anchor and display some surface proteins and are impaired in the 
      ability to cause animal infections. Sortase acts on surface proteins that are 
      initiated into the secretion (Sec) pathway and have their signal peptide removed by 
      signal peptidase. The S. aureus genome encodes two sets of sortase and secretion 
      genes. It is conceivable that S. aureus has evolved more than one pathway for the 
      transport of 20 surface proteins to the cell wall envelope.

TI  - Pentacyclic antibiotics from a tidal mud flat-derived actinomycete.
PG  - 524-9
LID - 10.1021/np500736b [doi]
AB  - The combination of investigating a unique source of chemically prolific bacterium 
      with an LC/MS-based bacterial strain selection approach resulted in the discovery of 
      two new secondary metabolites, buanmycin (1) and buanquinone (2), from the culture 
      of a marine Streptomyces strain, which was isolated from a tidal mudflat in Buan, 
      Republic of Korea. The carbon backbone of buanmycin (1), comprising 20 quaternary 
      carbons out of 30 total carbons, was determined via (13)C-(13)C COSY NMR analysis 
      after labeling 1 with (13)C by culturing the bacterium with (13)C-glucose. The 
      complete structure of 1 was confidently elucidated, primarily based on 1D and 2D NMR 
      spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis, as that of a new pentacyclic 
      xanthone. The absolute configuration of the α-methyl serine unit in 1 was 
      established by applying the advanced Marfey's method. The structure of buanquinone 
      (2) was determined to be a new pentacyclic quinone based on NMR and MS spectroscopic 
      data. Buanmycin exhibited potent cytotoxicity against colorectal carcinoma cells 
      (HCT-116) and gastric carcinoma cells (SNU-638) with submicromolar IC50 values and 
      strongly inhibited the pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica (MIC = 
      0.7 μM). In particular, buanmycin demonstrated inhibition of sortase A, which is a 
      promising target for antibiotic discovery.

AB  - Sortases are transpeptidases produced by Gram-positive bacteria to anchor cell 
      surface proteins covalently to the cell wall. The Staphylococcus aureus sortase A 
      (SrtA) cleaves a short C-terminal recognition motif (LPXTG) on the target protein 
      followed by the formation of an amide bond with the pentaglycine cross-bridge in the 
      cell wall. Over recent years, several researchers have exploited this specific 
      reaction for a range of biotechnology applications, including the incorporation of 
      non-native peptides and non-peptidic molecules into proteins, the generation of 
      nucleic acid-peptide conjugates and neoglycoconjugates, protein circularisation, and 
      labelling of cell surface proteins on living cells.

TI  - Epigallocatechin gallate inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae virulence by 
      simultaneously targeting pneumolysin and sortase A.
PG  - 2586-2598
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13179 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), the causative agent of several human 
      diseases, possesses numerous virulence factors associated with pneumococcal 
      infection and pathogenesis. Pneumolysin (PLY), an important virulence factor, is a 
      member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family and has cytolytic activity. 
      Sortase A (SrtA), another crucial pneumococcal virulence determinate, contributes 
      greatly to the anchoring of many virulence-associated surface proteins to the cell 
      wall. In this study, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural compound with little 
      known antipneumococcal activity, was shown to directly inhibit PLY-mediated 
      haemolysis and cytolysis by blocking the oligomerization of PLY and simultaneously 
      reduce the peptidase activity of SrtA. The biofilm formation, production of 
      neuraminidase A (NanA, the pneumococcal surface protein anchored by SrtA), and 
      bacterial adhesion to human epithelial cells (Hep2) were inhibited effectively when 
      S. pneumoniae D39 was cocultured with EGCG. The results from molecular dynamics 
      simulations and mutational analysis confirmed the interaction of EGCG with PLY and 
      SrtA, and EGCG binds to Glu277, Tyr358, and Arg359 in PLY and Thr169, Lys171, and 
      Phe239 in SrtA. In vivo studies further demonstrated that EGCG protected mice 
      against S. pneumoniae pneumonia. Our results imply that EGCG is an effective 
      inhibitor of both PLY and SrtA and that an antivirulence strategy that directly 
      targets PLY and SrtA using EGCG is a promising therapeutic option for S. pneumoniae 
      pneumonia.

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) from Gram positive pathogens is an attractive target for inhibitors 
      due to its role in the attachment of surface proteins to the cell wall. We found 
      that the plant natural product trans-chalcone inhibits Streptococcus mutans SrtA in 
      vitro and also inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation. Mass spectrometry revealed 
      that the trans-chalcone forms a Michael addition adduct with the active site 
      cysteine. The X-ray crystal structure of the SrtA H139A mutant provided new insights 
      into substrate recognition by the sortase family. Our study suggests that chalcone 
      flavonoids have potential as sortase-specific oral biofilm inhibitors.

TI  - The sortase of Streptococcus mutans mediates cell wall anchoring of a surface 
      protein antigen.
PG  - 266-9
AB  - Sortase has been shown to be a protease that catalyzes the cell wall anchoring of 
      surface proteins containing an LPXTG motif in gram-positive bacteria. In this study, 
      we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the sortase gene (srtA) of 
      Streptococcus mutans and found a surface protein that was linked to the cell wall by 
      the sortase. The results show that srtA gene of S. mutans consisted of 741 bp and 
      encoded for a sortase protein of 246 amino acids with a molecular weight of 27 489. 
      The deduced amino acid sequence of the S. mutans sortase was highly homologous 
      (65-58%) to those of other Streptococcal species. In a S. mutans mutant lacking 
      sortase, two surface proteins of 200 and 75 kDa were released to the culture 
      supernatant. Western blot analysis with specific antiserum showed that the 200 kDa 
      protein was a surface protein antigen designated PAc. These results suggest that the 
      sortase catalyzes anchoring of the antigen PAc to the cell wall.

TI  - Sorting of LPXTG peptides by archetypal sortase A: role of invariant substrate 
      residues in modulating the enzyme dynamics and conformational signature of a 
      productive substrate.
PG  - 2515-24
LID - 10.1021/bi4016023 [doi]
AB  - Transpeptidase sortase catalyzes the covalent anchoring of surface proteins to the 
      cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria. Sortase A (SrtA) of Staphylococcus aureus is a 
      prototype enzyme and considered a bona fide drug target because several substrate 
      proteins are virulence-related and implicated in pathogenesis. Besides, SrtA also 
      works as a versatile tool in protein engineering. Surface proteins destined for cell 
      wall anchoring contain a LPXTG sequence located in their C-terminus which serves as 
      a substrate recognition motif for SrtA. Recent studies have implicated 
      substrate-induced conformational dynamics in SrtA. In the present work, we have 
      explored the roles of invariant Leu and Pro residues of the substrate in modulating 
      the enzyme dynamics with a view to understand the selection process of a 
      catalytically competent substrate. Overall results of molecular dynamics simulations 
      and experiments carried out with noncanonical substrates and site-directed 
      mutagenesis reveal that the kinked conformation due to Pro in LPXTG is obligatory 
      for productive binding but does not per se control the enzyme dynamics. The Leu 
      residue of the substrate appears to play the crucial role of an anchor to the 
      beta6-beta7 loop directing the conformational transition of the enzyme from an 
      "open" to a "closed" state subsequent to which the Pro residue facilitates the 
      consummation of binding through predominant engagement of the loop and catalytic 
      motif residues in hydrophobic interactions. Collectively, our study provides 
      insights about specificity, tolerance, and conformational sorting of substrate by 
      SrtA. These results have important implications in designing newer substrates and 
      inhibitors for this multifaceted enzyme.

LID - 10.1021/ja302354v [doi]
AB  - Proteins containing a C-terminal thioester are important intermediates in 
      semisynthesis. Currently there is one main method for the synthesis of protein 
      thioesters that relies upon the use of engineered inteins. Here we report a simple 
      strategy, utilizing sortase A, for routine preparation of recombinant proteins 
      containing a C-terminal (α)thioester. We used our method to prepare two different 
      anthrax toxin cargo proteins: one containing an (α)thioester and another containing 
      a D-polypeptide segment situated between two protein domains. We show that both 
      variants can translocate through protective antigen pore. This new method to 
      synthesize a protein thioester allows for interfacing of sortase-mediated ligation 
      and native chemical ligation.

AB  - Tetralene and indene compounds have shown inhibitory activity against human 
      pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Their potential use as antistaphylococcal 
      agent against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has not been explored so far. We 
      determined in vitro antistaphylococcal activity and mechanism of action of these 
      compounds as sortase A inhibitors through in silico analysis followed by biological 
      assays. Tetralene and indene series were tested against S. aureus strains MTCC96, 
      MRSA, and VA30. Three compounds showed significant reduction in MIC in both 
      wild-type and drug-resistant S. aureus strains. In silico absorption, distribution, 
      metabolism, excretion, and toxicity analysis of identified leads and cytotoxicity 
      testing with colorimetric method using Vero and WRL-68 cell lines showed no 
      significant cytotoxic effects. Molecular docking of these molecules with sortase A 
      (PDB: 2KID) showed H-bond interaction with functional site residue Arg197 of sortase 
      A. Sortase A inhibition assay was developed by expressing SrtA∆N from S. aureus 
      strain MTCC96. Tetralene and indene compounds were found to have sortase A 
      inhibitory potential. S. aureus strain MTCC96 treated with these compounds showed 
      surface-sorting inhibition of fibronectin-binding protein and reduction in adherence 
      to host extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin. 1-Chloro, 2-formyl, 6-methoxy, 
      1-tetralene (Tet-5), 1,5-dichloro, 2-formyl, 1-indene (Tet-20) and 1-chloro, 
      2-formyl, 5,6-methylenedioxy, and 1-indene (Tet-21) exhibited antistaphylococcal 
      activity along with sortase A inhibition. The results also indicate the possible 
      role of these leads in other reactions essential for cell viability.

TI  - The involvement of sortase A in high virulence of STSS-causing Streptococcus suis

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA), originally identified as a transpeptidase in Staphylococcus 
      aureus, plays key roles in full virulence of pathogenic bacteria. In silico 
      genome-wide search suggested a srtA homologue from 05ZYH33, a Chinese human isolate 
      of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-causing Streptococcus suis serotype 2 
      (S. suis 2, SS2). An isogenic srtA mutant (DeltasrtA) of 05ZYH33 strain was obtained 
      by homologous recombination. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that two known 
      virulence-associated surface proteins featuring Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly motif, 
      muramidase-released protein and surface antigen one, were absent in the DeltasrtA. 
      Piglet infection experiments showed that deletion of srtA attenuated the full 
      virulence of 05ZYH33 strain, and impaired its colonizing potential in specific 
      organs. Furthermore, the DeltasrtA displayed significant reduction in adherence to 
      human cells (Hep-2 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells). Collectively, we 
      concluded that SrtA was involved in the virulence manifestation of STSS-causing SS2.

AB  - Gram-positive bacteria, in general, and staphylococci, in particular, are the 
      widespread cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections. The rapid 
      evolvement of strains resistant to antibiotics currently in use is a serious 
      challenge. Novel antimicrobial compounds have to be developed to fight these 
      resistant bacteria, and sortase A, a bacterial cell wall enzyme, is a promising 
      target for novel therapies. As a transpeptidase that covalently attaches various 
      virulence factors to the cell surface, this enzyme plays a crucial role in the 
      ability of bacteria to invade the host's tissues and to escape the immune response. 
      In this study we have screened a small molecule library against recombinant 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A using an in vitro FRET-based assay. The selected 
      hits were validated by NMR methods in order to exclude false positives and to 
      analyze the reversibility of inhibition. Further structural and functional analysis 
      of the best hit allowed the identification of a novel class of 
      benzisothiazolinone-based compounds as potent and promising sortase inhibitors.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA), is a major cause of pneumonia, resulting in severe morbidity and 
      mortality in adults and children. Sortase A (SrtA), which mediates the anchoring of 
      cell surface proteins in the cell wall, is an important virulence factor of S. 
      aureus. Here, we found that salvianolic acid A (Sal A), which is a natural product 
      that does not affect the growth of S. aureus, could inhibit SrtA activity 
      (IC(50) = 5.75 μg/ml) and repress the adhesion of bacteria to fibrinogen, the 
      anchoring of protein A to cell wall, the biofilm formation, and the ability of S. 
      aureus to invade A549 cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that Sal A 
      treatment reduced inflammation and protected mice against lethal pneumonia caused by 
      MRSA. More significantly, full protection (a survival rate of 100%) was achieved 
      when Sal A was administered in combination with latamoxef. Together, these results 
      indicate that Sal A could be developed into a promising therapeutic drug to combat 
      MRSA infections while limiting resistance development.

TI  - The role of Streptococcus pneumoniae sortase A in colonisation and pathogenesis.
PG  - 145-53
AB  - Sortase enzymes are found throughout Gram-positive bacteria and are responsible for 
      the covalent attachment of specific proteins to the cell wall. Through the anchoring 
      of these cell wall proteins, sortase enzymes are important in the ability of several 
      Gram-positive pathogens to cause disease. Previously, deletion of srtA from 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) was shown to disturb the localisation of 
      surface proteins, and decrease bacterial adherence to human pharyngeal cells in 
      vitro. Here we present data demonstrating, for the first time, a role for srtA as a 
      pneumococcal fitness factor in experimental models of pneumonia and bacteraemia. In 
      addition, srtA contributed to nasopharyngeal colonisation in vivo. Furthermore, we 
      find that the contribution of srtA varied between two pneumococcal strains. We show 
      that the known role of srtA in adherence in vitro is dependent on capsule 
      expression, the role of SrtA in adherence to human cells only being apparent in the 
      absence of the pneumococcal capsule. The srtA gene was detected by PCR in all 82 
      clinical isolates examined and sequencing of the gene from 20 strains showed srtA to 
      be highly conserved. The ubiquitous distribution of srtA was in contrast to the 
      other known pneumococcal sortase genes, srtB, C and D, which were found in only 14 
      of the 82 tested strains (17%).

TI  - Inhibition of sortase, a bacterial surface protein anchoring transpeptidase, by 
      beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside from Fritillaria verticillata.
PG  - 2477-9
AB  - A glucosylsterol, beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside, has been isolated as an 
      active principle with sortase inhibitory effect from the bulbs of Fritillaria 
      verticillata by bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation. The isolate was a 
      potent inhibitor of sortase, with an IC(50) value of 18.3 microg/ml and had 
      antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
      Micrococcus leuteus with MIC values of 50, 200, and 400 microg/ml, respectively, 
      indicating that this compound is a possible candidate for the development of a 
      bacterial sortase inhibitor. In addition, sitosterol was found to be inactive upon 
      sortase and bacterial cell growth. These results suggest that the inhibitory potency 
      of beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside is sensitively dependent upon the 
      glucopyranoside side chain moiety.

PG  - 1800-7
LID - 10.1038/nprot.2013.102 [doi]
AB  - This protocol describes the use of sortase-mediated reactions to label the N 
      terminus of any given protein of interest. The sortase recognition sequence, LPXTG 
      (for Streptococcus aureus sortase A) or LPXTA (for Staphylococcus pyogenes sortase 
      A), can be appended to a variety of probes such as fluorophores, biotin or even to 
      other proteins. The protein to be labeled acts as a nucleophile by attacking the 
      intermediate formed between the probe containing the LPXTG/A motif and the sortase 
      enzyme. If sortase, the protein of interest and a suitably functionalized label are 
      available, the reactions usually require less than 3 h.

TI  - An embarrassment of sortases - a richness of substrates?
PG  - 97-102
AB  - A range of surface proteins is anchored to the cell walls of Gram-positive pathogens 
      such as Staphylococcus aureus by the transpeptidase sortase. Until now, sortase-like 
      proteins and their substrates appeared to be limited mainly to such pathogens. 
      However, by searching for sortase homologues among complete and incomplete genome 
      sequences, we have found them to be present in almost all Gram-positives, a single 
      Gram-negative bacterium and an archaean. There is usually more than one sortase-like 
      protein encoded in each Gram-positive genome, and the genes encoding the 
      sortase-like proteins are often clustered with genes encoding their likely 
      substrates.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A transpeptidase. Calcium promotes sorting signal 
      binding by altering the mobility and structure of an active site loop.
PG  - 1817-26
AB  - Many virulence factors in gram-positive bacteria are covalently anchored to the 
      cell-wall peptidoglycan by sortase enzymes, a group of widely distributed cysteine 
      transpeptidases. The Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A protein (SrtA) is the 
      archetypal member of the Sortase family and is activated by Ca2+, an adaptation that 
      may facilitate host colonization as elevated concentrations of this ion are 
      encountered in human tissue. Here we show that a single Ca2+ ion bound to an ordered 
      pocket on SrtA allosterically activates catalysis by modulating both the structure 
      and dynamics of a large active site loop. Detailed nitrogen-15 relaxation 
      measurements indicate that Ca2+ may facilitate the adaptive recognition of the 
      substrate by inducing slow micro- to millisecond time-scale dynamics in the active 
      site. Interestingly, relaxation compensated Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill experiments 
      suggest that the time scale of these motions is directly correlated with ion 
      binding. The results of site-directed mutagenesis indicate that this motional 
      coupling is mediated by the side chain of Glu-171, which is positioned within the 
      beta6/beta7 loop and shown to contribute to Ca2+ binding. The available structural 
      and dynamics data are compatible with a loop closure model of Ca2+ activation, in 
      which the beta6/beta7 loop fluctuates between a binding competent closed form that 
      is stabilized by Ca2+, and an open, highly flexible state that removes key substrate 
      contacting residues from the active site.

TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis ΔSortase A strain elicits protective immunity against 
      Staphylococcus aureus infection.
PG  - 133-143
LID - 10.1007/s10482-016-0784-4 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are two of the most significant 
      opportunistic human pathogens, causing medical implant and nosocomial infections 
      worldwide. These bacteria contain surface proteins that play crucial roles in 
      multiple biological processes. It has become apparent that they have evolved a 
      number of unique mechanisms by which they can immobilise proteins on their surface. 
      Notably, a conserved cell membrane-anchored enzyme, sortase A (SrtA), can catalyse 
      the covalent attachment of precursor bacterial cell wall-attached proteins to 
      peptidoglycan. Considering its indispensable role in anchoring substrates to the 
      cell wall and its effects on virulence, SrtA has attracted great attention. In this 
      study, a 549-bp gene was cloned from a pathogenic S. epidermidis strain, YC-1, which 
      shared high identity with srtA from other Staphylococcus spp. A mutant strain, 
      YC-1ΔsrtA, was then constructed by allelic exchange mutagenesis. The direct survival 
      rate assay suggested that YC-1ΔsrtA had a lower survival capacity in healthy mice 
      blood compare with the wild-type strain, indicating that the deletion of srtA 
      affects the virulence and infectious capacity of S. epidermidis YC-1. YC-1ΔsrtA was 
      then administered via intraperitoneal injection and it provided a relative percent 
      survival value of 72.7 % in mice against S. aureus TC-1 challenge. These findings 
      demonstrate the possbility that YC-1ΔsrtA might be used as a live attenuated vaccine 
      to produce cross-protection against S. aureus.

TI  - Distribution of protein A on the surface of Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 4473-84
AB  - Surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus fulfill many important roles during the 
      pathogenesis of human infections and are anchored to the cell wall envelope by 
      sortases. Although the chemical linkage of proteins to cell wall cross bridges is 
      known, the mechanisms whereby polypeptides are distributed on the staphylococcal 
      surface have not been revealed. We show here that protein A, the ligand of 
      immunoglobulin, is unevenly distributed over the staphylococcal surface. Upon 
      removal with trypsin, newly synthesized polypeptide is deposited at two to four 
      discrete foci. During subsequent growth, protein A appears to be slowly distributed 
      from these sites. When viewed through multiple focal planes by laser scanning 
      microscopy, protein A foci are arranged in a circle surrounding the bacterial cell. 
      This pattern of distribution requires the LPXTG sorting signal of protein A as well 
      as sortase A, the transpeptidase that anchors polypeptides to cell wall cross 
      bridges. A model is presented whereby protein A deposition at discrete sites coupled 
      with cell wall synthesis enables distribution of protein A on the staphylococcal 
      surface.

TI  - Lethality of sortase depletion in Actinomyces oris caused by excessive membrane 
      accumulation of a surface glycoprotein.
PG  - 1227-41
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12780 [doi]
AB  - Sortase, a cysteine-transpeptidase conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, anchors on 
      the cell wall many surface proteins that facilitate bacterial pathogenesis and 
      fitness. Genetic disruption of the housekeeping sortase in several Gram-positive 
      pathogens reported thus far attenuates virulence, but not bacterial growth. 
      Paradoxically, we discovered that depletion of the housekeeping sortase SrtA was 
      lethal for Actinomyces oris; yet, all of its predicted cell wall-anchored protein 
      substrates (AcaA-N) were individually dispensable for cell viability. Using 
      Tn5-transposon mutagenesis to identify factors that upend lethality of srtA 
      deletion, we uncovered a set of genetic suppressors harbouring transposon insertions 
      within genes of a locus encoding AcaC and a LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP)-like protein. AcaC 
      was shown to be highly glycosylated and dependent on LCP for its glycosylation. Upon 
      SrtA depletion, the glycosylated form of AcaC, hereby renamed GspA, was accumulated 
      in the membrane. Overexpression of GspA in a mutant lacking gspA and srtA was 
      lethal; conversely, cells overexpressing a GspA mutant missing a 
      membrane-localization domain were viable. The results reveal a unique glycosylation 
      pathway in A. oris that is coupled to cell wall anchoring catalysed by sortase SrtA. 
      Significantly, this novel phenomenon of glyco-stress provides convenient cell-based 
      assays for developing a new class of inhibitors against Gram-positive pathogens.

AB  - Circular proteins occur naturally and have been found in microorganisms, plants, and 
      eukaryotes where they are commonly involved in host defense. Properties of circular 
      proteins include enhanced resistance to exoproteases, increased thermostability, 
      longer life spans, and increased activity. Using an enzymatic approach based on the 
      bacterial sortase A (SrtA) transpeptidase, N- and C-termini of conventional linear 
      proteins can be linked resulting in a circular protein. Circularization of 
      bioengineered linear substrate proteins can indeed confer the desirable properties 
      associated with circular proteins. Here, we describe how cells can be manipulated to 
      secrete circularized proteins for substrates of choice via sortase-mediated 
      circularization in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

TI  - Comparison of alternative nucleophiles for Sortase A-mediated bioconjugation and 
      application in neuronal cell labelling.
PG  - 2675-85
LID - 10.1039/c3ob42325e [doi]
AB  - The Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus catalyses covalent attachment 
      of protein substrates to pentaglycine cross-bridges in the Gram positive bacterial 
      cell wall. In vitro SrtA-mediated protein ligation is now an important protein 
      engineering tool for conjugation of substrates containing the LPXTGX peptide 
      recognition sequence to oligo-glycine nucleophiles. In order to explore the use of 
      alternative nucleophiles in this system, five different rhodamine-labelled 
      compounds, with N-terminal nucleophilic amino acids, triglycine, glycine, and 
      lysine, or N-terminal non-amino acid nucleophiles ethylenediamine and cadaverine, 
      were synthesized. These compounds were tested for their relative abilities to 
      function as nucleophiles in SrtA-mediated bioconjugation reactions. N-Terminal 
      triglycine, glycine and ethylenediamine were all efficient in labelling a range of 
      LPETGG containing recombinant antibody and scaffold proteins and peptides, while 
      reduced activity was observed for the other nucleophiles across the range of 
      proteins and peptides studied. Expansion of the range of available nucleophiles 
      which can be utilised in SrtA-mediated bioconjugation expands the range of potential 
      applications for this technology. As a demonstration of the utility of this system, 
      SrtA coupling was used to conjugate the triglycine rhodamine-labelled nucleophile to 
      the C-terminus of an Im7 scaffold protein displaying Aβ, a neurologically important 
      peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Purified, labelled protein showed 
      Aβ-specific targeting to mammalian neuronal cells. Demonstration of targeting 
      neuronal cells with a chimeric protein illustrates the power of this system, and 
      suggests that SrtA-mediated direct cell-surface labelling and visualisation is an 
      achievable goal.

AB  - Recently, sortase A (SrtA) from Staphyloccus aureus moved into the focus of 
      bioscience because of its ability to incorporate site specific modifications into 
      proteins. The enzyme was mostly used to modify target proteins in an analytical 
      scale, to study biomolecules in their cellular context. In this study, we show the 
      applicability of SrtA mediated ligation for site specific modification of proteins 
      in a large scale. Therefore, the reaction was first optimized using peptides and 
      subsequently new reaction conditions were applied for the large scale biotinylation 
      of interleukin-8. Furthermore, we established C-terminal immobilization of the SrtA 
      on a PEG based resin and could demonstrate maintaining enzymatic activity. 
      Immobilized SrtA significantly facilitates previous ligation protocols as the enzyme 
      can be easily recycled. Also, the removal of excess reaction solution and the whole 
      washing process is significantly accelerated, as centrifugation or filtration 
      techniques can be applied instead of time-consuming chromatography steps.

AB  - Recombinant protein therapeutics often suffer from short circulating half-life and 
      poor stability, necessitating multiple injections and resulting in limited 
      shelf-life. Conjugation to polyethylene glycol chains (PEG) extends the circulatory 
      half-life of many proteins, but the methods for attachment often lack specificity, 
      resulting in loss of biological activity. Using four-helix bundle cytokines as an 
      example, we present a general platform that uses sortase-mediated transpeptidation 
      to facilitate site-specific attachment of PEG to extend cytokine half-life with full 
      retention of biological activity. Covalently joining the N and C termini of proteins 
      to obtain circular polypeptides, again executed using sortase, increases thermal 
      stability. We combined both PEGylation and circularization by exploiting two 
      distinct sortase enzymes and the use of a molecular suture that allows both 
      site-specific PEGylation and covalent closure. The method developed is general, uses 
      a set of easily accessible reagents, and should be applicable to a wide variety of 
      proteins, provided that their termini are not involved in receptor binding or 
      function.

AB  - Sortagging is a versatile method for site-specific modification of proteins as 
      applied to a variety of in vitro reactions. Here, we explore possibilities of 
      adapting the sortase method for use in living cells. For intracellular sortagging, 
      we employ the Ca²⁺-independent sortase A transpeptidase (SrtA) from Streptococcus 
      pyogenes. Substrate proteins were equipped with the C-terminal sortase-recognition 
      motif (LPXTG); we used proteins with an N-terminal (oligo)glycine as nucleophiles. 
      We show that sortase-dependent protein ligation can be achieved in Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae and in mammalian HEK293T cells, both in the cytosol and in the lumen of 
      the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER luminal sortagging enables secretion of the 
      reaction products, among which circular polypeptides. Protein ligation of substrate 
      and nucleophile occurs within 30 min of translation. The versatility of the method 
      is shown by protein ligation of multiple substrates with green fluorescent 
      protein-based nucleophiles in different intracellular compartments.

AB  - Antibody fusion to nonprotein materials such as contrast agents or radio-tracers, 
      nano- or microparticles or small-molecule drugs is attracting major interest for 
      molecular imaging and drug delivery. Nondirected bioconjugation techniques may 
      impair antibody affinity, result in lower amounts of functional antibodies and 
      generate multicomponent mixtures. We present a detailed protocol for the enzymatic 
      bioconjugation of small recombinant antibodies to imaging particles, and we also 
      describe the generation of and conjugation to a low-fouling capsule assembled for 
      drug delivery from PEG and PVPON (poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) by a layer-by-layer (LbL) 
      technique. The single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is equipped with a short 
      C-terminal LPETG tag and the fusion partners are functionalized with an N-terminal 
      GGG nucleophilic group for sortase A conjugation. The LbL capsules are assembled 
      through hydrogen bonding by depositing alkyne-modified poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and 
      poly(methacrylic acid) layers on silica particles, followed by depositing 
      alkyne-modified PEG. The generation of the antibodies and LbL capsules takes ∼1-2 
      weeks each. The conjugation and functional testing takes another 3-4 d.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of enzymatic reactions on surfaces by real-time flow 
      cytometry: sortase a catalyzed protein immobilization as a case study.
PG  - 1492-500
LID - 10.1021/bc500230r [doi]
AB  - Only a few techniques, such as quartz crystal microbalance and surface plasmon 
      resonance spectroscopy, enable the analysis of dynamic processes on solid supports. 
      Here we have developed a straightforward assay based on flow cytometry to 
      continuously follow enzymatic reactions directly on microparticle surfaces. We 
      applied this real-time flow cytometry (RT-FCM) approach to study the covalent 
      immobilization of green-fluorescent protein (GFPuv) on triglycine-modified 
      polystyrene microbeads by the transpeptidase sortase A (SrtA) from Staphylococcus 
      aureus. Though commonly treated as functionally identical catalysts, the SrtA 
      variants SrtAΔ₅₉ and SrtAΔ₂₅, in which the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-59 and 
      1-25 of the native enzyme are truncated, were shown to perform very differently with 
      regard to this particular immobilization reaction. While SrtAΔ₅₉ efficiently 
      catalyzed the covalent attachment of GFPuv to the surface (as indicated by a linear 
      increase of microbead fluorescence), SrtAΔ₂₅ was essentially inactive. Besides the 
      length of the N-terminal amino acid extension on the SrtA construct, the position of 
      the hexahistidine tag at either the N- or C-terminus affected the efficiency of 
      enzymatic protein immobilization. Apart from three enzyme variants containing the 
      native core structure of SrtA, we also included three recently evolved mutants of 
      SrtA in this comparative study. With these mutants we observed a rapid initial 
      attachment of the GFPuv target protein to the microbeads. However, with proceeding 
      reaction time, cleavage of the covalently immobilized target protein from the 
      surface prevailed over the coupling reaction, consequently causing a decline of 
      microbead fluorescence. In general, the RT-FCM approach used herein represents a 
      powerful analytical tool for qualitative dynamic studies of many heterogeneous 
      enzymatic reactions or other binding events that influence the fluorescence 
      properties of microparticle surfaces.

AB  - The therapeutic index of drugs can be increased via drug encapsulation in actively 
      targeted, meaning ligand modified drug delivery systems. The manufacturing of such 
      targeted drug delivery systems, in particular the conjugation between drug carrier 
      and ligand, can be done by enzymatic conjugation methods, exploiting the 
      site-specific, bioorthogonal nature of these reactions. The use of such enzymes like 
      Sortase-A transpeptidase requires efficient purification methods, as residuals of 
      the enzyme may be responsible for immunogenic potential and drug product 
      instabilities. These instabilities may be based on the enzymatic reverse reaction, 
      meaning here a cleavage between ligand and drug carrier. In the presented work, two 
      differently PEGylated formulations were modified with variable fragments of camelid 
      heavy chain-only antibodies (VHH) via Sortase-A, purified by different methodologies 
      and tested for ligand cleavage upon storage. Strongly PEGylated liposomes 
      (PEG(high)-LS) were found to retain higher amounts of Sortase-A than lowly PEGylated 
      ones (PEG(low)-LS) after dialysis purification. Surprisingly, this did not correlate 
      with ligand stability during storage. PEG(high)-LS were less prone for degradation, 
      compared to PEG(low)-LS, which showed a ligand cleavage of 20% after an 8 weeks 
      storage at 2-8 °C. Nonetheless, overall degradation could be minimized by an 
      additional affinity bead purification procedure. Liposomes modified with a 
      CD11b-specific VHH were tested for their in vitro and in vivo targeting ability 
      towards CD11b(+) cells. Specific targeting of CD11b was achieved in vitro and in 
      vivo on various cell types. PEGylation decreased the targeting effect in vitro, 
      however no differences between PEG(high) or PEG(low) formulations were observed in 
      vivo. The obtained results underline the need for a thorough characterization of 
      novel conjugation strategies as well as an early in vivo characterization of such 
      targeted drug delivery systems.

AB  - Relaxin family is a group of peptide hormones with a variety of biological functions 
      by activating G protein-coupled receptors RXFP1-4. We recently developed 
      bioluminescent tracers for their receptor-binding assays by chemical conjugation 
      with the ultrasensitive NanoLuc reporter. To simplify preparation of the 
      bioluminescent tracers, in the present study, we established a sortase-catalysed 
      ligation approach using the chimeric R3/I5 as a model. Following catalysis by 
      recombinant sortase A, a NanoLuc reporter carrying the LPETG sortase recognition 
      motif at the C-terminus was efficiently ligated to an R3/I5 peptide carrying four 
      successive Gly residues at the A-chain N-terminus, via the formation of a peptide 
      bond between the C-terminal LPET sequence of NanoLuc and the A-chain N-terminal Gly 
      residue of R3/I5. Saturation binding assays demonstrated that the NanoLuc-ligated 
      R3/I5 retained high binding affinity to RXFP3 and RXFP4, with the calculated 
      dissociation constants (K (d)) of 4.34 ± 0.33 nM (n = 3) and 5.66 ± 0.54 nM (n = 3), 
      respectively. Using the NanoLuc-ligated R3/I5 as a tracer in competition binding 
      assays, binding potencies of various ligands towards RXFP3 and RXFP4 were 
      conveniently quantified. This work provides a simple method for rapid preparation of 
      bioluminescent tracers for relaxin family peptides and other protein/peptide 
      hormones for ligand-receptor interaction studies.

AB  - Chimeric protein toxins that act selectively on cells expressing a designated 
      receptor may serve as investigational probes and/or antitumor agents. Here, we 
      report use of the enzyme sortase A (SrtA) to create four chimeric toxins designed to 
      selectively kill cells bearing the tumor marker HER2. We first expressed and 
      purified: (i) a receptor recognition-deficient form of diphtheria toxin that lacks 
      its receptor-binding domain and (ii) a mutated, receptor-binding-deficient form of 
      anthrax-protective antigen. Both proteins carried at the C terminus the sortase 
      recognition sequence LPETGG and a H₆ affinity tag. Each toxin protein was mixed with 
      SrtA plus either of two HER2-recognition proteins--a single-chain antibody fragment 
      or an Affibody--both carrying an N-terminal G₅ tag. With wild-type SrtA, the fusion 
      reaction between the toxin and receptor-recognition proteins approached completion 
      only after several hours, whereas with an evolved form of the enzyme, SrtA*, the 
      reaction was virtually complete within 5 minutes. The four fusion toxins were 
      purified and shown to kill HER2-positive cells in culture with high specificity. 
      Sortase-mediated ligation of binary combinations of diverse natively folded proteins 
      offers a facile way to produce large sets of chimeric proteins for research and 
      medicine.

TI  - Tideglusib and Its Analogues As Inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus SrtA.
PG  - 8442-8457
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00803 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) anchors surface proteins to the cell wall envelope, and it has 
      attracted increasing interesting as a potential antivirulence target. Several 
      small-molecule inhibitors for SrtA have been developed, but target validation 
      remains largely underexplored. Herein, we report a new class of SrtA inhibitors that 
      supports antivirulence therapy through small-molecule targeting of SrtA. Tideglusib 
      (TD), a drug candidate for myotonic dystrophy, was outstanding in high-throughput 
      screening. A concise synthetic route quickly provided TD analogues, and the 
      structure-activity relationships for SrtA inhibition have been established from 
      those analogues. Several compounds largely retained the in vitro potency and 
      exhibited a better solubility than TD. Additionally, TD attenuated virulence-related 
      phenotypes in vitro and protected mice against lethal S. aureus USA300 bacteremia. 
      Our study indicates that TD and its analogues could be new candidates as SrtA 
      inhibitors with potential in the development of new antivirulence agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laboratory scale recombinant protein production and purification 
      techniques are often complicated, involving multiple chromatography steps and 
      specialized equipment and reagents. Here it was demonstrated that recombinant 
      proteins can be expressed as covalently immobilized to the surface of polyester 
      (polyhydroxyalkanoate, PHA) beads in vivo in Escherichia coli by genetically fusing 
      them to a polyester synthase gene (phaC). The insertion of a self-cleaving module, a 
      modified sortase A (SrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus and its five amino acid 
      recognition sequence between the synthase and the target protein led to a simple 
      protein production and purification method. RESULTS: The generation of hybrid genes 
      encoding tripartite PhaC-SrtA-Target fusion proteins, enabled immobilization of 
      proteins of interest to the surface of PHA beads in vivo. After simple cell lysis 
      and isolation of the PHA beads, the target proteins could be selectively and 
      efficiently released form the beads by activating the sortase with CaCl2 and 
      triglycine. Up to 6 mg/l of soluble proteins at a purity of ~98 % could be isolated 
      in one step with no optimization. This process was used to produce and isolate three 
      proteins: Green fluorescent protein, maltose binding protein and the Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis vaccine candidate Rv1626. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 
      technique for easy production and purification of recombinant proteins. This 
      technique is capable of producing and purifying high yields of proteins suitable for 
      research application in less than 2 days. No costly or specialized protein 
      chromatography equipment, resins, reagents or expertise are required.

TI  - Identification of sortase A (SrtA) substrates in Streptococcus uberis: evidence for 
      an additional hexapeptide (LPXXXD) sorting motif.
PG  - 1088-95
LID - 10.1021/pr901025w [doi]
AB  - Sortase (a transamidase) has been shown to be responsible for the covalent 
      attachment of proteins to the bacterial cell wall. Anchoring is effected on secreted 
      proteins containing a specific cell wall motif toward their C-terminus; that for 
      sortase A (SrtA) in Gram-positive bacteria often incorporates the sequence LPXTG. 
      Such surface proteins are often characterized as virulence determinants and play 
      important roles during the establishment and persistence of infection. Intramammary 
      infection with Streptococcus uberis is a common cause of bovine mastitis, which 
      impacts on animal health and welfare and the economics of milk production. 
      Comparison of stringently produced cell wall fractions from S. uberis and an 
      isogenic mutant strain lacking SrtA permitted identification of 9 proteins likely to 
      be covalently anchored at the cell surface. Analysis of these sequences implied the 
      presence of two anchoring motifs for S. uberis, the classical LPXTG motif and an 
      additional LPXXXD motif.

TI  - End-point immobilization of recombinant thrombomodulin via sortase-mediated 
      ligation.
PG  - 643-9
LID - 10.1021/bc200661w [doi]
AB  - We report an enzymatic end-point modification and immobilization of recombinant 
      human thrombomodulin (TM), a cofactor for activation of anticoagulant protein C 
      pathway via thrombin. First, a truncated TM mutant consisting of epidermal growth 
      factor-like domains 4-6 (TM(456)) with a conserved pentapeptide LPETG motif at its 
      C-terminal was expressed and purified in E. coli. Next, the truncated TM(456) 
      derivative was site-specifically modified with N-terminal diglycine containing 
      molecules such as biotin and the fluorescent probe dansyl via sortase A (SrtA) 
      mediated ligation (SML). The successful ligations were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and 
      fluorescence imaging. Finally, the truncated TM(456) was immobilized onto an 
      N-terminal diglycine-functionalized glass slide surface via SML directly. 
      Alternatively, the truncated TM(456) was biotinylated via SML and then immobilized 
      onto a streptavidin-functionalized glass slide surface indirectly. The successful 
      immobilizations were confirmed by fluorescence imaging. The bioactivity of the 
      immobilized truncated TM(456) was further confirmed by protein C activation assay, 
      in which enhanced activation of protein C by immobilized recombinant TM was 
      observed. The sortase A-catalyzed surface ligation took place under mild conditions 
      and occurs rapidly in a single step without prior chemical modification of the 
      target protein. This site-specific covalent modification leads to molecules being 
      arranged in a definitively ordered fashion and facilitating the preservation of the 
      protein's biological activity.

AB  - Protein A in Staphylococcus aureus is encoded by the spa (staphylococcal protein A) 
      gene and binds to immunoglobulin (Ig). The S. aureus strain Wood 46 has been 
      variously reported as protein A-deficient and/or spa negative and used as a control 
      in animal models of staphylococcal infections. The results of this study indicate 
      that Wood 46 has normal spa expression but transcribes very low levels of the srtA 
      gene which encodes the sortase A (SrtA) enzyme. This is consistent with unique 
      mutations in the srtA promoter. In this study, a low level of sortase A explains 
      deficient anchoring of proteins with an LPXTG motif, such as protein A, 
      fibrinogen-binding protein and fibronectin-binding proteins A and B on to the 
      peptidoglycan cell wall. The activity of secreted protein A is an important 
      consideration for use of Wood 46 in functional experiments and animal models.

      to the cell wall envelope.
PG  - 4646-55
AB  - Cell wall-anchored surface proteins of gram-positive pathogens play important roles 
      during the establishment of many infectious diseases, but the contributions of 
      surface proteins to the pathogenesis of anthrax have not yet been revealed. Cell 
      wall anchoring in Staphylococcus aureus occurs by a transpeptidation mechanism 
      requiring surface proteins with C-terminal sorting signals as well as sortase 
      enzymes. The genome sequence of Bacillus anthracis encodes three sortase genes and 
      eleven surface proteins with different types of cell wall sorting signals. Purified 
      B. anthracis sortase A cleaved peptides encompassing LPXTG motif-type sorting 
      signals between the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) residues in vitro. Sortase A 
      activity could be inhibited by thiol-reactive reagents, similar to staphylococcal 
      sortases. B. anthracis parent strain Sterne 34F(2), but not variants lacking the 
      srtA gene, anchored the collagen-binding MSCRAMM (microbial surface components 
      recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) BasC (BA5258/BAS4884) to the bacterial cell 
      wall. These results suggest that B. anthracis SrtA anchors surface proteins bearing 
      LPXTG motif sorting signals to the cell wall envelope of vegetative bacilli.

AB  - Chimeric proteins, including bispecific antibodies, are biological tools with 
      therapeutic applications. Genetic fusion and ligation methods allow the creation of 
      N-to-C and C-to-N fused recombinant proteins, but not unnaturally linked N-to-N and 
      C-to-C fusion proteins. This protocol describes a simple procedure for the 
      production of such chimeric proteins, starting from correctly folded proteins and 
      readily available peptides. By equipping the N terminus or C terminus of the 
      proteins of interest with a set of click handles using sortase A, followed by a 
      strain-promoted click reaction, unnatural N-to-N and C-to-C linked (hetero) fusion 
      proteins are established. Examples of proteins that have been conjugated via this 
      method include interleukin-2, interferon-α, ubiquitin, antibodies and several 
      single-domain antibodies. If the peptides, sortase A and the proteins of interest 
      are in hand, the unnaturally N-to-N and C-to-C fused proteins can be obtained in 3-4 
      d.

TI  - Mutagenesis studies of substrate recognition and catalysis in the sortase A 
      transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 14762-71
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M800974200 [doi]
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase sortase A (SrtA) is responsible for 
      anchoring a range of virulence- and colonization-associated proteins to the cell 
      wall. SrtA recognizes substrates that contain a C-terminal LPXTG motif. This 
      sequence is cleaved following the threonine, and an amide bond is formed between the 
      threonine and the pentaglycine cross-bridge of branched lipid II. Previous studies 
      have implicated the beta6/beta7 loop region of SrtA in LPXTG recognition but have 
      not systematically characterized this domain. To better understand the individual 
      roles of the residues within this loop, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis. 
      Val-168 and Leu-169 were found to be important for substrate recognition, and 
      Glu-171 was also found to be important, consistent with its hypothesized role as a 
      Ca(2+)-binding residue. Gly-167 and Asp-170 were dispensable for catalysis, as was 
      Gln-172. The role of Arg-197 in SrtA has been the subject of much debate. To explore 
      its role in catalysis, we used native chemical ligation to generate semi-synthetic 
      SrtA in which we replaced Arg-197 with citrulline, a non-ionizable analog. This 
      change resulted in a decrease of <3-fold in k(cat)/K(m), indicating that Arg-197 
      utilizes a hydrogen bond, rather than an electrostatic interaction. Our results are 
      consistent with a model for LPXTG recognition wherein the Leu-Pro sequence is 
      recognized primarily by hydrophobic contacts with SrtA Val-168 and Leu-169, as well 
      as a hydrogen bond from Arg-197. This model contradicts the previously proposed 
      mechanism of binding predicted by the x-ray crystal structure of SrtA.

TI  - Transpeptidation-Mediated Assembly of Tripartite Split Green Fluorescent Protein for 
      Label-Free Assay of Sortase Activity.
PG  - 3245-3252
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04756 [doi]
AB  - Transpeptidation of surface proteins catalyzed by the transpeptidase sortase plays a 
      critical role in the infection process of Gram-positive pathogen, and probing 
      sortase activity and screening its inhibitors are of great significance to 
      fundamental biological research and pharmaceutical development, especially novel 
      antivirulence drug design. Herein, we developed a novel fluorescent biosensor to 
      detect sortase activity based on a transpeptidation-triggered assembly of tripartite 
      split green fluorescent protein (split GFP). Peptide P(1), composed the 10th β-sheet 
      of GFP (GFP10) and the sortase A (SrtA) recognition sequence (LPETX), and peptide 
      P(2), the 11th β-sheet of GFP (GFP11) with oligoglycine at N-terminal, were designed 
      and synthesized, respectively. Existence of SrtA enables P(1) and P(2) to ligate 
      into one peptide, which could spontaneously bind to GFP1-9 (the 1st to 9th β-sheets 
      of GFP) and assemble into functional GFP. Thus, the sortase-catalyzed 
      transpeptidation can switch on the fluorescence signal of GFP. The method was 
      successfully applied to detect SrtA activity with a low detection limit of 0.16 nM 
      and for its inhibition measurement. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed assay 
      was further expanded to detect SrtA in human blood and further Gram-positive 
      pathogens analysis in frozen food. Our method, using tripartite split GFP as a 
      readout, is facile, label-free, and sensitive and exhibits great potential as a 
      promising platform for sortase detection and inhibitor screening.

TI  - Single mutation on the surface of Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A can disrupt its 
      dimerization.
PG  - 1667-74
LID - 10.1021/bi7014597 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A (SrtA) is an important Gram-positive membrane enzyme 
      which catalyzes the anchoring of many cell surface proteins conserved with the LPXTG 
      sequence. Recently SrtA has been demonstrated to be a dimer with a Kd of 55 microM 
      in vitro. Herein, we show that a single point mutation of amino acid residue on the 
      surface of SrtA can completely disrupt the dimerization. Native polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis and analytical gel filtration chromatography were used to detect the 
      dimer-monomer equilibrium of SrtA mutants. Circular dichroism spectrum experiments 
      were performed to study the conformational change of each SrtA mutant. An enzyme 
      activity assay confirmed that all the SrtA mutants were active in vitro. Our results 
      not only are important for understanding the SrtA protein self-associating mechanism 
      but also provided the necessary starting materials for the study of sortase A 
      pathway in vivo, which may have significant implications for discovering microbial 
      physiology and give a potential target for novel Gram-positive antibiotics.

TI  - Efficient segmental isotope labeling of multi-domain proteins using Sortase A.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1007/s10858-015-9981-0 [doi]
AB  - NMR studies of multi-domain protein complexes provide unique insight into their 
      molecular interactions and dynamics in solution. For large proteins domain-selective 
      isotope labeling is desired to reduce signal overlap, but available methods require 
      extensive optimization and often give poor ligation yields. We present an optimized 
      strategy for segmental labeling of multi-domain proteins using the S. aureus 
      transpeptidase Sortase A. Critical improvements compared to existing protocols are 
      (1) the efficient removal of cleaved peptide fragments by centrifugal filtration and 
      (2) a strategic design of cleavable and non-cleavable affinity tags for 
      purification. Our approach enables routine production of milligram amounts of 
      purified segmentally labeled protein for NMR and other biophysical studies.

PG  - 539-548
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00638 [doi]
AB  - Conjugation of llama single domain antibody fragments (Variable Heavy chain domains 
      of Heavy chain antibodies, VHHs) to diagnostic or therapeutic nanoparticles, 
      peptides, proteins, or drugs offers many opportunities for optimized targeted cancer 
      treatment. Currently, mostly nonspecific conjugation strategies or genetic fusions 
      are used that may compromise VHH functionality. In this paper we present a versatile 
      modular approach for bioorthogonal VHH modification and conjugation. First, sortase 
      A mediated transPEGylation is used for introduction of a chemical click moiety. The 
      resulting clickable VHHs are then used for conjugation to other groups employing the 
      Cu(+)-independent strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloadition (SPAAC) reaction. Using 
      this approach, tail-to-tail bispecific VHHs and VHH-targeted nanoparticles are 
      generated without affecting VHH functionality. Furthermore, this approach allows the 
      bioconjugation of multiple moieties to VHHs for simple and convenient production of 
      VHH-based theranostics.

AB  - A general chemoenzymatic method for the site-specific attachment of lipids to

      range of hydrophobic modifications in excellent yield (60-90%), including a simple 
      step for removing the sortase enzyme postreaction. Lipoproteins prepared using these 
      procedures were subsequently shown to associate with mammalian cells in a lipid 
      tail-dependent fashion and localized to the plasma membrane and endosomes.

AB  - Creation of site-specifically labeled protein bioconjugates is an important tool for 
      the molecular biologist and cell biologist. Chemical labeling methods, while 
      versatile with respect to the types of moieties that can be attached, suffer from 
      lack of specificity, often targeting multiple positions within a protein. Here we 
      describe protocols for the chemoenzymatic labeling of proteins at the C-terminus 
      using the bacterial transpeptidase, sortase A. We detail a protocol for the 
      purification of an improved pentamutant variant of the Staphylococcus aureus enzyme 
      (SrtA 5(o)) that exhibits vastly improved kinetics relative to the wild-type enzyme. 
      Importantly, a protocol for the construction of peptide probes compatible with 
      sortase labeling using techniques that can be adapted to any cellular/molecular 
      biology lab with no existing infrastructure for synthetic chemistry is described. 
      Finally, we provide an example of how to optimize the labeling reaction using the 
      improved SrtA 5(o) variant.

AB  - Sortases are cysteine transpeptidases that are essential for the assembly and 
      anchoring of cell-surface adhesins in Gram-positive bacteria. In Streptococcus 
      agalactiae (GBS), the pilin-specific sortase SrtC1 catalyzes the polymerization of 
      pilins encoded by pilus island 1 (PI-1) and the housekeeping sortase SrtA is 
      necessary for cell-wall anchoring of the resulting pilus polymers. These sortases 
      are known to utilize different substrates for pilus polymerization and cell-wall 
      anchoring; however, the structural correlates that dictate their substrate 
      specificity have not yet been clearly defined. This report presents the expression, 
      purification and crystallization of SrtC1 (SAG0647) and SrtA (SAG0961) from S. 
      agalactiae strain 2603V/R. The GBS SrtC1 has been crystallized in three crystal 
      forms and the GBS SrtA has been crystallized in one crystal form.

TI  - The binding mechanism, multiple binding modes, and allosteric regulation of 
      Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A probed by molecular dynamics simulations.
PG  - 1858-71
LID - 10.1002/pro.2168 [doi]
AB  - Sortase enzymes are vitally important for the virulence of gram-positive bacteria as 
      they play a key role in the attachment of surface proteins to the cell wall. These 
      enzymes recognize a specific sorting sequence in proteins destined to be displayed 
      on the surface of the bacteria and catalyze the transpeptidation reaction that links 
      it to a cell wall precursor molecule. Because of their role in establishing 
      pathogenicity, and in light of the recent rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial 
      strains, sortase enzymes are novel drug targets. Here, we present a study of the 
      prototypical sortase protein Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A (SrtA). Both 
      conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of S. aureus SrtA in its 
      apo state and when bound to an LPATG sorting signal (SS) were performed. Results 
      support a binding mechanism that may be characterized as conformational selection 
      followed by induced fit. Additionally, the SS was found to adopt multiple metastable 
      states, thus resolving discrepancies between binding conformations in previously 
      reported experimental structures. Finally, correlation analysis reveals that the SS 
      actively affects allosteric pathways throughout the protein that connect the first 
      and the second substrate binding sites, which are proposed to be located on opposing 
      faces of the protein. Overall, these calculations shed new light on the role of 
      dynamics in the binding mechanism and function of sortase enzymes.

AB  - Creation of functional protein bioconjugates demands methods for attaching a diverse 
      array of probes to target proteins with high specificity, under mild conditions. The 
      sortase A transpeptidase enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus catalyzes the cleavage of 
      a short 5-aa recognition sequence (LPXTG) with the concomitant formation of an amide 
      linkage between an oligoglycine peptide and the target protein. By functionalizing 
      the oligoglycine peptide, it is possible to incorporate reporters into target 
      proteins in a site-specific fashion. This reaction is applicable to proteins in 
      solution and on the living cell surface. The method described in this unit only 
      requires incubation of the target protein, which has been engineered to contain a 
      sortase recognition site either at the C terminus or within solvent-accessible 
      loops, with a purified sortase enzyme and a suitably functionalized oligoglycine 
      peptide.

AB  - Single-domain antibody fragments, also called nanobodies (Nbs), are increasingly 
      being used as targeting molecular tools for imaging and/or targeted radionuclide 
      therapy. To translate these tools to the clinic, it is preferred to obtain a 
      homogeneous, well-defined, and well-characterized product. It has been shown that 
      Sortase A, a transpeptidase found in Staphylococcus aureus, catalyzes the 
      site-specific conjugation between a recognition oligopeptide (LPXTG, known as 
      sortag) and an oligoglycine functionalized probe. This versatile technique manages 
      to couple various molecular reagents, such as biotin, fluorophores, bifunctional 
      chelators, etc., to the target protein containing the sortag. This chapter focuses 
      on the site-specific coupling of a bifunctional chelator (e.g., CHX-A"-DTPA) to a Nb 
      equipped with a C-terminal sortag. The chelator conjugated to the Nb can be 
      radiolabeled with (111)In or (177)Lu for SPECT imaging or targeted radionuclide 
      therapy, respectively.

TI  - The biology of Gram-positive sortase enzymes.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - Surface proteins of Gram-positive pathogens play various key roles in pathogenicity. 
      Therefore, these proteins are of great interest in terms of understanding the 
      infection process and have potential as targets for therapy. A major mechanism for 
      the surface display of proteins by Gram-positive bacteria is sortase-mediated 
      covalent attachment to the cell wall. The importance of sortase enzymes in the 
      virulence of several pathogens is now becoming apparent, as are some of the more 
      detailed workings of the enzyme and anchoring pathway. These recent advances are 
      discussed.

AB  - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major health problem that 
      has created a pressing need for new antibiotics. Compounds that inhibit the S. 
      aureus SrtA sortase may function as potent anti-infective agents as this enzyme 
      attaches virulence factors to the cell wall. Using high-throughput screening, we 
      have identified several compounds that inhibit the enzymatic activity of the SrtA. A 
      structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis led to the identification of several 
      pyridazinone and pyrazolethione analogs that inhibit SrtA with IC(50) values in the 
      sub-micromolar range. Many of these molecules also inhibit the sortase enzyme from 
      Bacillus anthracis suggesting that they may be generalized sortase inhibitors.

TI  - Visualization and Quantification of Sortase Activity at the Single-Molecule Level 
      via Transpeptidation-Directed Intramolecular Förster Resonance Energy Transfer.
PG  - 13007-13012
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03716 [doi]
AB  - The sortase-catalyzed coupling reaction is an efficient strategy to incorporate 
      chemically defined modifications into proteins of interest. Despite its widespread 
      applications in protein chemistry, the conventional bulk fluorescence measurement is 
      not sufficient to characterize sortase due to the fluorescence inner filter 
      effect-induced self-quenching. Herein, we develop a new method to visualize and 
      quantify sortase A (SrtA) activity at the single-molecule level by using 
      transpeptidation-directed intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). 
      This assay utilizes two cyanine dye-peptide conjugates, in which one carries an 
      LPXTG motif and a donor fluorophore while the other harbors an oligoglycine 
      nucleophile and an acceptor fluorophore as the substrate of SrtA. The presence of 
      SrtA catalyzes the fusion of two conjugates and allows for the occurrence of 
      intramolecular FRET. The FRET signal is recorded at the single-molecule level via 
      total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-based imaging. The proposed assay not 
      only can accurately determine the kinetic parameters of SrtA but also can 
      characterize the inhibition of SrtA activity by berberine chloride both in vitro and 
      in Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus) cells. Moreover, the assay is very specific, 
      and it can sensitively measure SrtA down to 7.08 pM, which is much lower than most 
      of the reported methods. This strategy may provide a valuable tool for an in-depth 
      study of sortases and for the discovery of anti-infective agents.

TI  - Development of a novel ligand binding assay for relaxin family peptide receptor 3

LID - 10.1007/s00726-018-2588-5 [doi]
AB  - Relaxin family peptides perform a variety of biological functions by binding and 
      activating relaxin family peptide receptor 1-4 (RXFP1-4), four A-class G 
      protein-coupled receptors. In the present work, we developed a novel ligand binding 
      assay for RXFP3 and RXFP4 based on NanoLuc complementation technology (NanoBiT). A 
      synthetic ligation version of the low-affinity small complementation tag (SmBiT) was 
      efficiently ligated to the A-chain N terminus of recombinant chimeric agonist R3/I5 
      using recombinant circular sortase A. After the ligation product R3/I5-SmBiT was 
      mixed with human RXFP3 or RXFP4 genetically fused with a secretory large NanoLuc 
      fragment (sLgBiT) at the N terminus, NanoLuc complementation was induced by 
      high-affinity ligand-receptor binding. Binding kinetics and affinities of 
      R3/I5-SmBiT with sLgBiT-fused RXFP3 and RXFP4 were conveniently measured according 
      to the complementation-induced bioluminescence. Using R3/I5-SmBiT and the 
      sLgBiT-fused receptor as a complementation pair, binding potencies of various 
      ligands with RXFP3 and RXFP4 were quantitatively measured without the cumbersome 
      washing step. The novel NanoBiT-based ligand binding assay is convenient for use and 
      suitable for automation, thus will facilitate interaction studies of RXFP3 and RXFP4 
      with ligands in future. This assay can also be applied to some other plasma membrane 
      receptors for pharmacological characterization of ligands in future studies.

TI  - The use of chlorogenic acid and its analogues as inhibitors: an investigation of the 
      inhibition of sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus using molecular docking and dynamic 
      simulation.
PG  - 1341-7
LID - 10.1007/s10529-016-2112-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use molecular docking and dynamic simulation to investigate the 
      inhibitory action of chlorogenic acid (CHA) and its analogues against sortase A of 
      Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Five novel, natural inhibitors with different 
      activities were discovered for sortase A (SrtA). The inhibition mechanism of the 
      novel inhibitors was consistent with the mechanism of CHA, which was reported 
      previously by Wang et al. (Front Microbiol 6:1031, 2015). Based on 
      structure-activity relationship analysis, the hydroxyl moiety (C1) of the inhibitors 
      is critical in the catalytic region of SrtA, which could be confirmed by the 
      calculation of the binding free energy between SrtA and the inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The mechanism obtained by molecular dynamics simulation is thus useful for the 
      development of novel, selective SrtA inhibitors.

LID - 10.1007/s00203-009-0520-9 [doi]
AB  - Recombinant sortase A (SrtA) was used to immune rabbit, and the inhibitory activity 
      of anti-SrtA serum on Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation was tested. Biofilm 
      formation was inhibited by anti-SrtA rabbit serum in S. aureus ATCC25923 and two 
      clinical isolated strains. The antiserum was separated into two fractions, and the 
      main component with the inhibitory activity was demonstrated to be the IgG fraction. 
      Two proteins interact with the IgG fraction were identified by using an in vitro 
      pull-down assay and were confirmed to be lipase 2 and gamma-hemolysin by mass 
      spectrometry. Cross-interaction between SrtA and lipase 2 was further confirmed by 
      Western blotting. Addition of anti-lipase 2 serum in the culture medium also showed 
      inhibitory effect against biofilm formation. Together, our study suggests anti-SrtA 
      serum inhibits S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase 2 is one of the targets of 
      anti-SrtA serum in this inhibition process. This is the first study to demonstrate 
      the roles of antisera against SrtA and lipase 2 in the inhibition of biofilm 
      formation in S. aureus.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A is an attractive target of Gram-positive bacteria 
      that plays a crucial role in anchoring of surface proteins to peptidoglycan present 
      in bacterial cell wall. Inhibiting sortase A is an elementary and essential effort 
      in preventing the pathogenesis. In this context, in silico virtual screening of 
      in-house database was performed using ligand based pharmacophore model as a filter. 
      The developed pharmacophore model AAHR 11 consists of two acceptors, one hydrophobic 
      and one ring aromatic feature. Top ranked molecule KKR1 was docked into the active 
      site of the target. After profound analysis, it was analyzed and optimized based on 
      the observations from its binding pose orientation. Upgraded version of KKR1 was 
      KKR2 and has improved docking score, binding interactions and best fit in the 
      binding pocket. KKR1 along with KKR2 were further validated using 100 ns molecular 
      dynamic studies. Both KKR1 and KKR2 contain Indole-thiazolidine moiety and were 
      synthesized. The disk diffusion assay has good initial results (ZI of KKR1, KKR2 
      were 24, 38 mm at 10 μg/mL and ZI of Ampicillin was 22 at 10 μg/mL) and calculated 
      MICs of the molecules (KKR1 5.56±0.28 μg/mL, KKR2 1.32±0.12 μg/mL, Ampicillin 8±1.1 
      μg/mL) were in good agreement with standard drug Ampicillin. KKR1 has shown IC50 of 
      1.23±0.14 μM whereas the optimized lead molecule KKR2 show IC50 of 0.008±0.07 μM. 
      Results from in silico were validated by in vitro studies and proved that 
      indole-thiazolidine molecules would be useful for future development as lead 
      molecules against S. aureus sortase A.

TI  - Efficient Enzymatic Ligation of Inhibitor Cystine Knot Spider Venom Peptides: Using 
      Sortase A To Form Double-Knottins That Probe Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Na(V)1.7.
PG  - 3309-3319
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00505 [doi]
AB  - Gating modifier toxins from spider venom are disulfide-rich peptides that typically 
      comprise a stabilizing inhibitor cystine knot (ICK). These knottin peptides are 
      being pursued as therapeutic leads for a range of conditions linked to transmembrane 
      proteins. Recently, double-knottin peptides discovered in spider venom and produced 
      by recombinant expression have provided insights into the pharmacology of 
      transmembrane channels. Here, we use chemoenzymatic ligation to produce 
      double-knottins to probe the effect of bivalent modulation on the voltage-gated 
      sodium channel subtype 1.7 (Na(V)1.7), which is implicated in pain signaling. 
      Monovalent knottins were oxidatively folded and then biochemically conjugated using 
      sortase A, to form double-knottins. The structural integrity of the peptides was 
      confirmed using NMR, and fluorescence-based activity assays provided evidence 
      suggesting that coincubated monovalent and bivalent knottins can cooperatively 
      modulate Na(V)1.7. We anticipate that double-knottins will provide novel tools for 
      enhancing our understanding of, and design strategies for, therapeutically relevant 
      voltage-gated ion channels.

PG  - 23996-4006
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M111.247650 [doi]
AB  - The housekeeping transpeptidase sortase A (SrtA) from Staphyloccocus aureus 
      catalyzes the covalent anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall by linking the 
      threonyl carboxylate of the LPXTG recognition motif to the amino group of the 
      pentaglycine cross-bridge of the peptidoglycan. SrtA-catalyzed ligation of an LPXTG 
      containing polypeptide with an aminoglycine-terminated moiety occurs efficiently in 
      vitro and has inspired the use of this enzyme as a synthetic tool in biological 
      chemistry. Here we demonstrate the propensity of SrtA to catalyze "isopeptide" 
      ligation. Using model peptide sequences, we show that SrtA can transfer LPXTG 
      peptide substrates to the ε-amine of specific Lys residues and form cyclized and/or 
      a gamut of branched oligomers. Our results provide insights about principles 
      governing isopeptide ligation reactions catalyzed by SrtA and suggest that although 
      cyclization is guided by distance relationship between Lys (ε-amine) and Thr 
      (α-carboxyl) residues, facile branched oligomerization requires the presence of a 
      stable and long-lived acyl-enzyme intermediate.

PG  - 461-75
LID - 10.1007/s00253-012-4569-z [doi]
AB  - The process of protein crosslinking comprises the chemical, enzymatic, or 
      chemoenzymatic formation of new covalent bonds between polypeptides. This allows (1) 
      the site-directed coupling of proteins with distinct properties and (2) the de novo 
      assembly of polymeric protein networks. Transferases, hydrolases, and 
      oxidoreductases can be employed as catalysts for the synthesis of crosslinked 
      proteins, thereby complementing chemical crosslinking strategies. Here, we review 
      enzymatic approaches that are used for protein crosslinking at the industrial level 
      or have shown promising potential in investigations on the lab-scale. We illustrate 
      the underlying mechanisms of crosslink formation and point out the roles of the 
      enzymes in their natural environments. Additionally, we discuss advantages and 
      drawbacks of the enzyme-based crosslinking strategies and their potential for 
      different applications.

TI  - A Concise Approach to Site-Specific Topological Protein-Poly(amino acid) Conjugates 
      Enabled by in Situ-Generated Functionalities.
PG  - 10995-1000
LID - 10.1021/jacs.6b05413 [doi]
AB  - Controlling the topology of polymer-modified proteins has attracted growing 
      interest. However, one of the main challenges in this field is the lack of efficient 
      and site-specific methods for installing multiple bioorthogonal functionalities on 
      substrate polymers. We report here an orchestrating strategy that provides easy 
      access to various topological protein-poly(amino acid) (PAA) conjugates in high 
      yields. This method features the in situ installation of two "chemical handles", 
      including a thioester for native chemical ligation and a polyglycine nucleophile for 
      sortase A-mediated ligation, at both ends of substrate PAAs. As a result, neither 
      pre-functionalization of initiator or monomer units, nor post-polymerization 
      modification of the resultant polymers, is necessary. Site-specific topological 
      conjugates, particularly circular conjugates, can be conveniently synthesized under 
      mild conditions from the functionalized PAAs. The biomedical utility of our method 
      is demonstrated by the rapid and efficient generation of several therapeutic 
      interferon-α conjugates, which exhibit significantly enhanced protease resistance 
      and thermostability. Given the versatility of both PAAs and proteins, the method 
      offers a convenient approach to producing libraries of conjugates for biological 
      applications.

AB  - The enzyme-mediated site-specific bioconjugation of a radioactive metal complex to a 
      single-chain antibody using the transpeptidase sortase A is reported. Cage amine 
      sarcophagine ligands that were designed to function as substrates for the sortase A 
      mediated bioconjugation to antibodies were synthesized and enzymatically conjugated 
      to a single-chain variable fragment. The antibody fragment scFv(anti-LIBS) targets 
      ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS) on the glycoprotein receptor GPIIb/IIIa, which 
      is present on activated platelets. The immunoconjugates were radiolabeled with the 
      positron-emitting isotope (64)Cu. The new radiolabeled conjugates were shown to bind 
      selectively to activated platelets. The diagnostic potential of the most promising 
      conjugate was demonstrated in an in vivo model of carotid artery thrombosis using 
      positron emission tomography. This approach gives homogeneous products through 
      site-specific enzyme-mediated conjugation and should be broadly applicable to other 
      metal complexes and proteins.

TI  - Molecular Mechanism of the Flavonoid Natural Product Dryocrassin ABBA against 
      Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A.
LID - 1428
AB  - The intractability of bacterial resistance presents a dilemma for therapies against 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. Effective anti-virulence strategies are 
      urgently needed, reflecting the proliferation of resistant strains. Inhibitors of 
      sortase A (SrtA), enzymes that anchor virulence-related surface proteins, are 
      regarded as promising candidates for countermeasures against bacterial infections. 
      In the present study, the inhibitory effect of dryocrassin ABBA (ABBA) against SrtA 
      and its molecular basis has been examined. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
      (FRET) assays were used to determine the inhibitory activity of ABBA against SrtA. 
      To identify the mechanism underlying this activity, molecular dynamics simulations 
      and mutagenesis assays were applied, and the results revealed that the direct 
      engagement of SrtA via ABBA through binding to V166 and V168 significantly 
      attenuated the catalytic activity of SrtA. Taken together, these findings indicated 
      that ABBA is a potential novel antimicrobial agent for S. aureus infection via 
      targeting SrtA.

TI  - Phloretin Attenuates Listeria monocytogenes Virulence Both In vitro and In vivo by 
      Simultaneously Targeting Listeriolysin O and Sortase A.
PG  - 9

AB  - The critical roles of sortase A (SrtA) and listeriolysin O (LLO) in Listeria 
      monocytogenes pathogenicity render these two virulence factors as ideal targets for 
      the development of anti-virulence agents against L. monocytogenes infection. 
      Additionally, the structures of SrtA and LLO are highly conserved among the members 
      of sortase enzyme family and cholesterol dependent toxin family. Here, phloretin, a 
      natural polyphenolic compound derived from apples and pears that has little anti-L. 
      monocytogenes activity, was identified to simultaneously inhibit LLO expression and 
      neutralize SrtA catalytic activity. Phloretin neutralized SrtA activity by causing a 
      conformational change in the protein's active pocket, which prevented engagement 
      with its substrate. Treatment with phloretin simultaneously reduced L. monocytogenes 
      invasion into host cells and blocked the escape of vacuole-entrapped L. 
      monocytogenes into cytoplasm. Further, L. monocytogenes-infected mice that received 
      phloretin showed lower mortality, decreased bacterial burden and reduced 
      pathological injury. Our results demonstrate that phloretin is a promising 
      anti-infective therapeutic for infections caused by L. monocytogenes due to its 
      simultaneous targeting of SrtA and LLO, which may result in fewer side effects than 
      those caused by other antibiotics.

PG  - 11164-11170
LID - 10.1002/anie.201804506 [doi]
AB  - Increased tolerance of enzymes towards thermal and chemical stress is required for 
      many applications and can be achieved by macrocyclization of the enzyme resulting in 
      the stabilizing of its tertiary structure. Thus far, macrocyclization approaches 
      utilize a very limited structural diversity, which complicates the design process. 
      Herein, we report an approach that enables cyclization through the installation of 
      modular crosslinks into native proteins composed entirely of proteinogenic amino 
      acids. Our stabilization procedure involves the introduction of three 
      surface-exposed cysteine residues, which are reacted with a triselectrophile, 
      resulting in the in situ cyclization of the protein (INCYPRO). A bicyclic version of 
      sortase A was designed that exhibits increased tolerance towards thermal as well as 
      chemical denaturation, and proved to be efficient in protein labeling under 
      denaturing conditions. In addition, we applied INCYPRO to the KIX domain, resulting 
      in up to 24 °C increased thermal stability.

AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins and intrinsically disordered regions are 
      implicated in many biological functions and associated with many diseases, but their 
      conformational characterizations are challenging. The disordered β6/β7 loop of 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A is involved in the binding of both sorting signals 
      and calcium. Calcium binding allosterically activates the enzyme, but the detailed 
      mechanism has been unclear. Here we adapted the replica exchange with solute 
      tempering method to sample the conformations of the β6/β7 loop, in apo form and in 
      three liganded forms (bound with a sorting signal or calcium or both). The extensive 
      molecular dynamics simulations yield atomic details of the disordered-to-order 
      transition of the loop and suggest a mechanism for allosteric activation: calcium 
      binding results in partial closure and ordering of the loop, thereby leading to 
      preorganization of the binding pocket for the sorting signal. The approach has 
      general applicability to the study of intrinsically disordered regions.

AB  - Ribosomal natural products contain exquisite post-translational peptide 
      modifications that are installed by a range of pathway-specific enzymes. We present 
      proof of principle for a Sortase A-based approach that enables peptide modification

      new-to-nature, hybrid ribosomal natural product.

TI  - Enzymatic Protein-Protein Conjugation through Internal Site Verified at the 
      Single-Molecule Level.

AB  - Enzymes are widely used for protein ligation because of their efficient and 
      site-specific connections under mild conditions. However, many enzymatic ligations 
      are restricted to connections between protein termini while protein-protein 
      conjugation at a specific internal site is limited. Previous work has found that 
      Sortase A (SrtA) conjugates small molecules/peptides to a pilin protein at an 
      internal lysine site via an isopeptide bond. Herein, we apply this noncanonical 
      ligation property of SrtA for protein-protein conjugation at a designed YPKH site. 
      Both a small protein domain, I27, and a large protein, GFP, were ligated at the 
      designed internal site. Moreover, besides characterization by classic methods at the 
      ensemble level, the specific ligation site at the interior YPKH motif is 
      unambiguously verified by atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force 
      spectroscopy, showing the characteristic unfolding signature at the single-molecule 
      level. Finally, steered molecular dynamics simulations also agreed with the results.

TI  - Sortase Enzyme-Mediated Generation of Site-Specifically Conjugated Antibody Drug 
      Conjugates with High In Vitro and In Vivo Potency.

LID - e0131177
AB  - Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have recently been proven to be highly potent 
      anti-tumor drugs, typically exceeding the efficacy of conventional monoclonal 
      antibodies (mAbs). ADCs are currently produced by chemical conjugation of a 
      small-molecule toxin to the mAb through lysine or cysteine side chains. This leads 
      to heterogeneous mixtures of ADCs in which variable numbers of drugs are conjugated 
      to individual antibodies and in which the site of conjugation cannot be defined. 
      Consequently, there is currently significant interest in further development of drug 
      conjugation technologies, with a particular focus on site-specific payload 
      conjugation. Here, we present an enzymatic conjugation platform based on the S. 
      aureus sortase A-mediated transpeptidation reaction, allowing the efficient 
      generation of ADCs with toxins conjugated to pre-defined sites at pre-defined 
      drug-to-antibody ratios. For this, two modifications were introduced: first, 
      immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chains were modified at their C-termini 
      by addition of the sortase A recognition motif LPETG, and second, the small molecule 
      tubulin polymerization inhibitors monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) and maytansine were 
      modified by addition of a pentaglycine peptide, thus making them suitable substrates 
      for sortase A-mediated transpeptidation. We demonstrate efficient generation and 
      characterization of the anti-CD30 ADC Ac10-vcPAB-MMAE, an enzymatically conjugated 
      counterpart of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris), as well as several anti-HER-2 ADCs 
      including trastuzumab-maytansine, the counterpart of trastuzumab emtansine 
      (Kadcyla). ADCs generated in this manner were found to display in vitro cell killing 
      activities indistinguishable from the classic conjugates. Further, when tested in 
      vivo in a HER-2-overexpressing ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model, enzymatically 
      generated trastuzumab-maytansine was found to lead to complete regression of 
      established tumors, similar to Kadcyla.

AB  - Folding and stability are parameters that control protein behavior. The possibility 
      of conferring additional stability on proteins has implications for their use in 
      vivo and for their structural analysis in the laboratory. Cyclic polypeptides 
      ranging in size from 14 to 78 amino acids occur naturally and often show enhanced 
      resistance toward denaturation and proteolysis when compared with their linear 
      counterparts. Native chemical ligation and intein-based methods allow production of 
      circular derivatives of larger proteins, resulting in improved stability and 
      refolding properties. Here we show that circular proteins can be made reversibly 
      with excellent efficiency by means of a sortase-catalyzed cyclization reaction, 
      requiring only minimal modification of the protein to be circularized.

AB  - S. aureus sortase A (SrtA), a calcium-dependent transpeptidase, is frequently 
      employed to site-specifically label the C-terminus of recombinant proteins bearing 
      an LPXTG SrtA recognition motif. Unfortunately, SrtA suffers from low turnover 
      rates, resulting in poor ligation efficiencies even with optimized reaction 
      conditions. In this chapter, we describe proximity-based sortase-mediated ligation 
      (PBSL), which uses the SpyTag-SpyCatcher peptide-protein pair to link SrtA to target 
      proteins and dramatically improves reaction rate and ligation efficiency.

TI  - Clumping factor A, von Willebrand factor-binding protein and von Willebrand factor 
      anchor Staphylococcus aureus to the vessel wall.

AB  - Essentials Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) binds to endothelium via von Willebrand 
      factor (VWF). Secreted VWF-binding protein (vWbp) mediates S. aureus adhesion to VWF 
      under shear stress. vWbp interacts with VWF and the Sortase A-dependent surface 
      protein Clumping factor A (ClfA). VWF-vWbp-ClfA anchor S. aureus to vascular 
      endothelium under shear stress. SUMMARY: Objective When establishing endovascular 
      infections, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) overcomes shear forces of flowing 
      blood by binding to von Willebrand factor (VWF). Staphylococcal VWF-binding protein 
      (vWbp) interacts with VWF, but it is unknown how this secreted protein binds to the 
      bacterial cell wall. We hypothesized that vWbp interacts with a staphylococcal 
      surface protein, mediating the adhesion of S. aureus to VWF and vascular endothelium 
      under shear stress. Methods We studied the binding of S. aureus to vWbp, VWF and 
      endothelial cells in a micro-parallel flow chamber using various mutants deficient 
      in Sortase A (SrtA) and SrtA-dependent surface proteins, and Lactococcus lactis 
      expressing single staphylococcal surface proteins. In vivo adhesion of bacteria was 
      evaluated in the murine mesenteric circulation using real-time intravital vascular 
      microscopy. Results vWbp bridges the bacterial cell wall and VWF, allowing 
      shear-resistant binding of S. aureus to inflamed or damaged endothelium. Absence of 
      SrtA and Clumping factor A (ClfA) reduced adhesion of S. aureus to vWbp, VWF and 
      activated endothelial cells. ADAMTS-13 and an anti-VWF A1 domain antibody, when 
      combined, reduced S. aureus adhesion to activated endothelial cells by 90%. 
      Selective overexpression of ClfA in the membrane of Lactococcus lactis enabled these 
      bacteria to bind to VWF and activated endothelial cells but only in the presence of 
      vWbp. Absence of ClfA abolished bacterial adhesion to the activated murine vessel 
      wall. Conclusions vWbp interacts with VWF and with the SrtA-dependent staphylococcal 
      surface protein ClfA. The complex formed by VWF, secreted vWbp and bacterial ClfA 
      anchors S. aureus to vascular endothelium under shear stress.

TI  - The sortase SrtA of Listeria monocytogenes is involved in processing of internalin 
      and in virulence.
PG  - 1382-90
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular gram-positive human pathogen that invades 
      eucaryotic cells. Among the surface-exposed proteins playing a role in this invasive 
      process, internalin belongs to the family of LPXTG proteins, which are known to be 
      covalently linked to the bacterial cell wall in gram-positive bacteria. Recently, it 
      has been shown in Staphylococcus aureus that the covalent anchoring of protein A, a 
      typical LPXTG protein, is due to a cysteine protease, named sortase, required for 
      bacterial virulence. Here, we identified in silico from the genome of L. 
      monocytogenes a gene, designated srtA, encoding a sortase homologue. The role of 
      this previously unknown sortase was studied by constructing a sortase knockout 
      mutant. Internalin was used as a reporter protein to study the effects of the srtA 
      mutation on cell wall anchoring of this LPXTG protein in L. monocytogenes. We show 
      that the srtA mutant (i) is affected in the display of internalin at the bacterial 
      surface, (ii) is significantly less invasive in vitro, and (iii) is attenuated in 
      its virulence in the mouse. These results demonstrate that srtA of L. monocytogenes 
      acts as a sortase and plays a role in the pathogenicity.

TI  - Catalytic mechanism and roles of Arg197 and Thr183 in the Staphylococcus aureus 
      sortase A enzyme.
PG  - 13003-11
LID - 10.1021/jp2058113 [doi]
AB  - The sortase A enzyme, which catalyzes the peptidoglycan cell wall anchoring reaction 
      of LPXTG surface proteins, has been proposed to be a universal target for 
      therapeutic agents against Gram-positive bacteria. The catalytic mechanism of the 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A enzyme has been systematically studied using 
      molecular dynamics simulations, ONIOM(DFT:MM) calculations, and QM/MM charge 
      deletion analysis. The catalytic roles of Arg197 and Thr183 were analyzed. Our 
      calculations show that Arg197 has several important roles in the mechanism. It is 
      crucial for substrate binding, and is capable of reversible shift of its hydrogen 
      bonds between the LP and TG carbonyls of the LPXTG substrate motif, depending on the 
      protonation state of the catalytic Cys184-His120 dyad. Arg197 stabilizes the 
      catalytic dyad in the active ion pair form but at the same time raises the barrier 
      to acylation by approximately 8 kcal/mol. Thr183 is also essential for the catalytic 
      reaction in that it correspondingly lowers the barrier by the same amount via 
      electrostatic interactions. The catalytic mechanism proceeds via proton transfer 
      from His120, followed by nucleophilic attack from the thiolate anion of Cys184. The 
      data thus supports the proposed reverse protonation mechanism, and disproves the 
      hypothesis of the Arg197 generating an oxyanion hole to stabilize the tetrahedral 
      intermediate of the reaction.

TI  - Sortase D forms the covalent bond that links BcpB to the tip of Bacillus cereus 
      pili.
PG  - 12989-97
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M900927200 [doi]
AB  - Bacillus cereus and other Gram-positive bacteria elaborate pili via a sortase 
      D-catalyzed transpeptidation mechanism from major and minor pilin precursor 
      substrates. After cleavage of the LPXTG sorting signal of the major pilin, BcpA, 
      sortase D forms an amide bond between the C-terminal threonine and the amino group 
      of lysine within the YPKN motif of another BcpA subunit. Pilus assembly terminates 
      upon sortase A cleavage of the BcpA sorting signal, resulting in a covalent bond 
      between BcpA and the cell wall cross-bridge. Here, we show that the IPNTG sorting 
      signal of BcpB, the minor pilin, is cleaved by sortase D but not by sortase A. The 
      C-terminal threonine of BcpB is amide-linked to the YPKN motif of BcpA, thereby 
      positioning BcpB at the tip of pili. Thus, unique attributes of the sorting signals 
      of minor pilins provide Gram-positive bacteria with a universal mechanism ordering 
      assembly of pili.

      bionanoparticles with targeting and detection moieties often suffer from unfavorable 
      spacing and orientation as well as bionanoparticle aggregation. Herein, we report a 
      highly modular post-translational modification approach for biosensor assembly based 
      on sortase A-mediated ligation. This approach enables the simultaneous modifications 
      of the Bacillus stearothermophilus E2 nanoparticles with different functional 
      moieties for antibody, enzyme, DNA aptamer, and dye decoration. The resulting 
      easy-purification platform offers a high degree of targeting and detection 
      modularity with signal amplification. This flexibility is demonstrated for the 
      detection of both immobilized antigens and cancer cells.

TI  - Sortase-catalyzed initiator attachment enables high yield growth of a stealth 
      polymer from the C terminus of a protein.
PG  - 1256-60

AB  - Conventional methods for synthesizing protein/peptide-polymer conjugates, as a means 
      to improve the pharmacological properties of therapeutic biomolecules, typically 
      have drawbacks including low yield, non-trivial separation of conjugates from 
      reactants, and lack of site- specificity, which results in heterogeneous products 
      with significantly compromised bioactivity. To address these limitations, the use of 
      sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus is demonstrated to site-specifically attach an 
      initiator solely at the C-terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP), followed by 
      in situ growth of a stealth polymer, poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether 
      methacrylate) by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Sortase-catalyzed 
      initiator attachment proceeds with high specificity and near-complete (≈95%) product 
      conversion. Subsequent in situ ATRP in aqueous buffer produces 1:1 stoichiometric 
      conjugates with >90% yield, low dispersity, and no denaturation of the protein. This 
      approach introduces a simple and useful method for high yield synthesis of 
      protein/peptide-polymer conjugates.

TI  - Engineering of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody to single chain 
      format and labeling by Sortase A-mediated protein ligation.
PG  - 1461-70
LID - 10.1002/bit.24407 [doi]
AB  - Sortase-mediated protein ligation is a biological covalent conjugation system 
      developed from the enzymatic cell wall display mechanism found in Staphylococcus 
      aureus. This three-component system requires: (i) purified Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme; 
      (ii) a substrate containing the LPXTG peptide recognition sequence; and (iii) an 
      oligo-glycine acceptor molecule. We describe cloning of the single-chain antibody 
      sc528, which binds to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR), from the parental monoclonal antibody and incorporation of a LPETGG 
      tag sequence. Utilizing recombinant SrtA, we demonstrate successful incorporation of 
      biotin from GGG-biotin onto sc528. EGFR is an important cancer target and is 
      over-expressed in human tumor tissues and cancer lines, such as the A431 epithelial 
      carcinoma cells. SrtA-biotinylated sc528 specifically bound EGFR expressed on A431 
      cells, but not negative control lines. Similarly, when sc528 was labeled with 
      fluorescein we observed antigen-specific labeling. The ability to introduce 
      functionality into recombinant antibodies in a controlled, site-specific manner has 
      applications in experimental, diagnostic, and potentially clinical settings. For 
      example, we demonstrate addition of all three reaction components in situ within a 
      biosensor flow cell, resulting in oriented covalent capture and presentation of 
      sc528, and determination of precise affinities for the antibody-receptor 
      interaction.

TI  - Highly oriented recombinant glycosyltransferases: site-specific immobilization of 
      unstable membrane proteins by using Staphylococcus aureus sortase A.
PG  - 2604-14
LID - 10.1021/bi100094g [doi]
AB  - Recombinant glycosyltransferases are potential biocatalysts for the construction of 
      a compound library of oligosaccharides, glycosphingolipids, glycopeptides, and 
      various artificial glycoconjugates on the basis of combined chemical and enzymatic 
      synthetic procedures. The structurally defined glycan-related compound library is a 
      key resource both in the basic studies of their functional roles in various 
      biological processes and in the discovery research of new diagnostic biomarkers and 
      therapeutic reagents. Therefore, it is clear that the immobilization of extremely 
      unstable membrane-bound glycosyltransferases on some suitable supporting materials 
      should enhance the operational stability and activity of recombinant enzymes and 
      makes facile separation of products and recycling use of enzymes possible. Until 
      now, however, it seems that no standardized protocol preventing a significant loss 
      of enzyme activity is available due to the lack of a general method of 
      site-selective anchoring between glycosyltransferases and scaffold materials through 
      a stable covalent bond. Here we communicate a versatile and efficient method for the 
      immobilization of recombinant glycosyltransferases onto commercially available solid 
      supports by means of transpeptidase reaction by Staphylococcus aureus sortase A. 
      This protocol allowed for the first time highly specific conjugation at the 
      designated C-terminal signal peptide moiety of recombinant human 
      beta1,4-galactosyltransferase or recombinant Helicobacter pylori 
      alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase with simple aliphatic amino groups displayed on the 
      surface of solid materials. Site-specifically immobilized enzymes exhibited the 
      desired sugar transfer activity, an improved stability, and a practical reusability 
      required for rapid and large-scale synthesis of glycoconjugates. Considering that 
      most mammalian enzymes responsible for the posttranslational modifications, 
      including the protein kinase family, as well as glycosyltransferases are unstable 
      and highly oriented membrane proteins, the merit of our strategy based on 
      "site-specific" transpeptidation is evident because the reaction proceeds only at an 
      engineered C-terminus without any conformational influence around the active sites 
      of both enzymes as well as heptad repeats of rHFucT required to maintain native 
      secondary and quaternary structures during the dimerization on cell surfaces.

      A-mediated transpeptidation.
PG  - 650-5
LID - 10.1021/bc200694t [doi]
AB  - A new method was developed for site-specific modifications of liposomes by proteins 
      via sortase A (SrtA)-mediated transpeptidation reactions. In this regard, the 
      enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was biologically engineered to carry at 
      its polypeptide C-terminus the LPATG motif recognized by SrtA and used as the 
      protein donor for linking to liposomes that were decorated with phospholipids 
      carrying a diglycine motif as the other SrtA substrate and the eGFP acceptor. Under 
      the influence of SrtA, eGFP was efficiently attached to liposomes, as proved by 
      analyzing the enzymatic reaction products and the resultant fluorescent liposomes. 
      It was observed that increasing the concentration and the distance of the diglycine 
      motif on and from the liposome surface could significantly improve the efficiency of 
      liposome modification by proteins. It is anticipated that this strategy can be 
      widely useful for the modification of liposomes by other proteins.

PG  - 1603-7
LID - 10.1007/s10529-008-9718-1 [doi]
AB  - The immobilization of proteins to surfaces is an active area of research due to 
      strong interest in protein-based sensors. Here, we describe a novel method for 
      immobilizing ligand proteins onto Biacore sensor chips using the transpeptidase 
      activity of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA). This method provides a robust 
      and gentle approach for the site-directed, covalent coupling of proteins to 
      biosensor chips. Notably, the high specificity of the sortase allows immobilization 
      of proteins from less than pure protein samples allowing short cuts in protein 
      purification protocols.

PG  - 221-6
AB  - Surface proteins in Gram-positive bacteria are anchored to the cell wall by the 
      action of sortase enzymes. The Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) protein 
      anchors proteins by recognizing a cell wall sorting signal containing the amino acid 
      sequence LPXTG. To understand how SrtA binds this sequence, we carried out NMR 
      studies of new peptidyl-cyanoalkene and peptidyl-sulfhydryl inhibitors that contain 
      the sorting signal sequence LPAT. These studies combined with amino acid mutagenesis 
      identified a catalytically important and conserved binding surface formed by 
      residues A118, T180, and I182. Compatible with its recently proposed role as a 
      general base, R197 is also shown to be required for catalysis.

TI  - Site-specific protein labeling with amine-containing molecules using Lactobacillus 
      plantarum sortase.

AB  - Modification of proteins with small molecules is a widely used and powerful tool in 
      biological research. Enzymatic approaches are particularly promising because 
      substrate specificity allows for site-specific modification. Sortase A, a 
      transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus, cleaves between the T and G residues in 
      the sequence LPXTG, and subsequently links the carboxyl group of the T residue to an 
      amino group of N-terminal glycine oligomers by a native peptide bond. Although 
      Gram-positive bacteria have several kinds of sortases, there are few reports 
      concerning their expression and substrate specificity. Here, we demonstrate 
      site-specific protein modification with primary amine-containing molecules catalyzed 
      by Lactobacillus plantarum sortase. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was 
      employed as a model protein, and an amine-containing biotin molecule was 
      site-specifically conjugated with LPQTSEQ-tagged EGFP. We developed a novel 
      Lactobacillus plantarum sortase that has different substrate specificity compared to 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase. Amine-directed protein modification was achieved 
      using the Lactobacillus plantarum sortase ''LPQTSEQ'' sequence original recognition 
      tag. Our results demonstrate a promising method for expanding the capabilities of 
      site-specific protein-small molecule modification.

TI  - Sortase independent and dependent systems for acquisition of haem and haemoglobin in 
      Listeria monocytogenes.
PG  - 1581-97
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07667.x [doi]
AB  - We studied three Fur-regulated systems of Listeria monocytogenes: the srtB region, 
      that encodes sortase-anchored proteins and a putative ABC transporter, and the fhu 
      and hup operons, that produce putative ABC transporters for ferric hydroxamates and 
      haemin (Hn)/haemoglobin (Hb) respectively. Deletion of lmo2185 in the srtB region 
      reduced listerial [(59) Fe]-Hn transport, and purified Lmo2185 bound [(59) Fe]-Hn 
      (K(D) = 12 nM), leading to its designation as a Hn/Hb binding protein (hbp2). 
      Purified Hbp2 also acted as a haemophore, capturing and supplying Hn from the 
      environment. Nevertheless, Hbp2 only functioned in [(59) Fe]-Hn transport at 
      external concentrations less than 50 nM: at higher Hn levels its uptake occurred 
      with equivalent affinity and rate without Hbp2. Similarly, deletion of sortase A had 
      no effect on ferric siderophore or Hn/Hb transport at any concentration, and the 
      srtA-independence of listerial Hn/Hb uptake distinguished it from comparable systems 
      of Staphylococcus aureus. In the cytoplasmic membrane, the Hup transporter was 
      specific for Hn: its lipoprotein (HupD) only showed high affinity for the iron 
      porphyrin (K(D) = 26 nM). Conversely, the FhuD lipoprotein encoded by the fhu operon 
      had broad specificity: it bound both ferric siderophores and Hn, with the highest 
      affinity for ferrioxamine B (K(D) = 123 nM). Deletions of Hup permease components 
      hupD, hupG or hupDGC reduced Hn/Hb uptake, and complementation of ΔhupC and ΔhupG by 
      chromosomal integration of hupC(+) and hupG(+) alleles on pPL2 restored growth 
      promotion by Hn/Hb. However, ΔhupDGC did not completely eliminate [(59) Fe]-Hn 
      transport, implying the existence of another cytoplasmic membrane Hn transporter. 
      The overall K(M) of Hn uptake by wild-type strain EGD-e was 1 nM, and it occurred at 
      similar rates (V(max) = 23 pmol 10(9) cells(-1) min(-1)) to those of ferric 
      siderophore transporters. In the ΔhupDGC strain uptake occurred at a threefold lower 
      rate (V(max) = 7 pmol 10(9) cells(-1) min(-1)). The results show that at low (< 50 
      nM) levels of Hn, SrtB-dependent peptidoglycan-anchored proteins (e.g. Hbp2) bind 
      the porphyrin, and HupDGC or another transporter completes its uptake into the 
      cytoplasm. However, at higher concentrations Hn uptake is SrtB-independent: 
      peptidoglycan-anchored binding proteins are dispensable because HupDGC directly 
      absorbs and internalizes Hn. Finally, ΔhupDGC increased the LD(50) of L. 
      monocytogenes 100-fold in the mouse infection model, reiterating the importance of 
      this system in listerial virulence.

AB  - Cell wall anchored virulence factors are critical for infection and colonization of 
      the host by Gram-positive bacteria. Such proteins have an N-terminal leader sequence 
      and a C-terminal sorting signal, composed of an LPXTG motif, a hydrophobic stretch, 
      and a few positively charged amino acids. The sorting signal halts translocation 
      across the membrane, allowing sortase to cleave the LPXTG motif, leading to surface 
      anchoring. Deletion of sortase prevents the anchoring of virulence factors to the 
      wall; the effects on bacterial physiology however, have not been thoroughly 
      characterized. Here we show that deletion of Streptococcus pyogenes sortase A leads 
      to accumulation of sorting intermediates, particularly at the septum, altering 
      cellular morphology and physiology, and compromising membrane integrity. Such cells 
      are highly sensitive to cathelicidin, and are rapidly killed in blood and plasma. 
      These phenomena are not a loss-of-function effect caused by the absence of anchored 
      surface proteins, but specifically result from the accumulation of sorting 
      intermediates. Reduction in the level of sorting intermediates leads to a return of 
      the sortase mutant to normal morphology, while expression of M protein with an 
      altered LPXTG motif in wild type cells leads to toxicity in the host environment, 
      similar to that observed in the sortase mutant. These unanticipated effects suggest 
      that inhibition of sortase by small-molecule inhibitors could similarly lead to the 
      rapid elimination of pathogens from an infected host, making such inhibitors much 
      better anti-bacterial agents than previously believed.

AB  - Methods for site-specific modification of proteins should be quantitative and 
      versatile with respect to the nature and size of the biological or chemical targets 
      involved. They should require minimal modification of the target, and the underlying 
      reactions should be completed in a reasonable amount of time under physiological 
      conditions. Sortase-mediated transpeptidation reactions meet these criteria and are 
      compatible with other labeling methods. Here we describe the expression and 
      purification conditions for two sortase A enzymes that have different recognition 
      sequences. We also provide a protocol that allows the functionalization of any given 
      protein at its C terminus, or, for select proteins, at an internal site. The target 
      protein is engineered with a sortase-recognition motif (LPXTG) at the place where 
      modification is desired. Upon recognition, sortase cleaves the protein between the 
      threonine and glycine residues, facilitating the attachment of an exogenously added 
      oligoglycine peptide modified with the functional group of choice (e.g., 
      fluorophore, biotin, protein or lipid). Expression and purification of sortase takes 
      ∼3 d, and sortase-mediated reactions take only a few minutes, but reaction times can 
      be extended to increase yields.

AB  - PURPOSE: Conventional chemotherapy is associated with therapy-limiting side effects, 
      which might be alleviated by targeted chemotherapeutics such as immunoliposomes. The 
      targeting ligands of immunoliposomes are commonly attached by unspecific chemical 
      conjugation, bearing risk of structural heterogeneity and therewith related 
      biological consequences. Chemoenzymatic methods may mitigate such risks through 
      site-specific conjugation. METHODS: The formulation parameters for 
      pentaglycine-modified, doxorubicin-loaded liposomes and the reaction conditions for 
      a site-specific, Sortase-A mediated conjugation with monoclonal antibodies were 
      thoroughly evaluated. The cytotoxicity of such sortagged, epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR)-specific immunoliposomes was tested on human breast cancer cells. 
      RESULTS: Sortaggable liposomes with a defined size (140 nm, PDI < 0.25) and high 
      encapsulation efficiency (>90%) were obtained after manufacturing optimization. A 
      ratio of 1.0-2.5 µM mAb/100 µM pentaglycine yielded stable dispersions and 
      circumvented carrier precipitation during ligand grafting. The cytotoxicity on 
      EGFR(+) MDA-MB-468 was up to threefold higher for EGFR-specific immunoliposomes than 
      for the nontargeted controls. CONCLUSIONS: Sortase-A is suitable to generate 
      immunoliposomes with a site-specific ligand-carrier linkage and hence improves 
      chemical homogeneity of targeted therapeutics. However, the sweet spot for 
      manufacturability utilizing mAbs with two Sortase-A recognition sites is narrow, 
      making mono-reactive binders such as scFvs or Fab's preferable for a further 
      development. Despite this, the immunoliposomes demonstrated a targeted delivery of 
      doxorubicin, indicating the potential to increase the therapeutic window during the 
      treatment of EGFR(+) tumors.

AB  - We have examined the potential of displaying a protease species in vitro using 
      ribosome display and demonstrate specific capture on the basis of its catalytic 
      activity. Using a model bacterial cysteine protease, sortase A (SrtA), we show that 
      this enzyme can be functionally expressed in vitro. By overlap PCR we constructed 
      ribosome display templates with the SrtA open reading frame fused to a C terminal 
      glycine-serine rich flexible linker and a tether derived from eGFP. Using the broad 
      range cysteine protease irreversible inhibitor E-64 linked to acrylic beads, we show 
      that we can isolate SrtA ribosome display ternary complexes, and recover their 
      encoding mRNA by RT-PCR. This recovery was lost when applied to a SrtA catalytically 
      inactive mutant, or could be alleviated by competition with free inhibitor. This 
      sensitive technique could be further developed to allow the screening of proteases 
      against putative inhibitors and/or the identification of novel proteolytic species.

TI  - Engineering the substrate specificity of Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A. The 
      beta6/beta7 loop from SrtB confers NPQTN recognition to SrtA.
PG  - 6571-81
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA) anchors virulence and 
      colonization-associated surface proteins to the cell wall. SrtA selectively 
      recognizes a C-terminal LPXTG motif, whereas the related transpeptidase Sortase B 
      (SrtB) recognizes a C-terminal NPQTN motif. In both enzymes, cleavage occurs after 
      the conserved threonine, followed by amide bond formation between threonine and the 
      pentaglycine cross-bridge of cell wall peptidoglycan. Genetic and biochemical 
      studies strongly suggest that SrtA and SrtB exhibit exquisite specificity for their 
      recognition motifs. To better understand the origins of substrate specificity within 
      these two isoforms, we used sequence and structural analysis to predict residues and 
      domains likely to be involved in conferring substrate specificity. Mutational 
      analyses and domain swapping experiments were conducted to test their function in 
      substrate recognition and specificity. Marked changes in the specificity profile of 
      SrtA were obtained by replacing the beta6/beta7 loop in SrtA with the corresponding 
      domain from SrtB. The chimeric beta6/beta7 loop swap enzyme (SrtLS) conferred the 
      ability to acylate NPQTN-containing substrates, with a k(cat)/K(m)(app) of 0.0062 
      +/- 0.003 m(-1) s(-1). This enzyme was unable to perform the transpeptidation stage 
      of the reaction, suggesting that additional domains are required for 
      transpeptidation to occur. The overall catalytic specificity profile 
      (k(cat)/K(m)(app)(NPQTN)/k(cat)/K(m)(app)(LPETG)) of SrtLS was altered 700,000-fold 
      from SrtA. These results indicate that the beta6/beta7 loop is an important site for 
      substrate recognition in sortases.

TI  - Sortase anchored proteins of Streptococcus uberis play major roles in the 
      pathogenesis of bovine mastitis in dairy cattle.
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1051/vetres/2010036 [doi]

AB  - Streptococcus uberis, strain 0140J, contains a single copy sortase A (srtA), 
      encoding a transamidase capable of covalently anchoring specific proteins to 
      peptidoglycan. Unlike the wild-type, an isogenic mutant carrying an inactivating 
      ISS1 insertion within srtA was only able to infect the bovine mammary gland in a 
      transient fashion. For the first 24 h post challenge, the srtA mutant colonised at a 
      similar rate and number to the wild type strain, but unlike the wild type did not 
      subsequently colonise in higher numbers. Similar levels of host cell infiltration 
      were detected in response to infection with both strains, but only in those mammary 
      quarters infected with the wild type strain were clinical signs of disease evident. 
      Mutants that failed to express individual sortase substrate proteins (sub0135, 
      sub0145, sub0207, sub0241, sub0826, sub0888, sub1095, sub1154, sub1370, and sub1730) 
      were isolated and their virulence determined in the same challenge model. This 
      revealed that mutants lacking sub0145, sub1095 and sub1154 were attenuated in 
      cattle. These data demonstrate that a number of sortase anchored proteins each play 
      a distinct, non-redundant and important role in pathogenesis of S. uberis infection 
      within the lactating bovine mammary gland.

TI  - Implication of sortase-dependent proteins of Streptococcus thermophilus in adhesion 
      to human intestinal epithelial cell lines and bile salt tolerance.
PG  - 3667-79
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-7322-1 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) is a lactic acid bacterium widely used in dairy 
      industry and displays several properties which could be beneficial for host. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate, in vitro, the implication of sortase A 
      (SrtA) and sortase-dependent proteins (SDPs) in the adhesion of ST LMD-9 strain to 
      intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and resistance to bile salt mixture (BSM; 
      taurocholoate, deoxycholate, and cholate). The effect of mutations in prtS 
      (protease), mucBP (MUCin-Binding Protein), and srtA genes in ST LMD-9 in these 
      mechanisms were examined. The HT29-MTX, HT29-CL.16E, and Caco-2 TC7 cell lines were 
      used. HT29-MTX and HT29-CL.16E cells express different mucins found in the gastro 
      intestinal tract; whereas, Caco-2 TC7 express cell surface proteins found in the 
      small intestine. All mutants showed different adhesion profiles depending on cell 
      lines. The mutation in genes srtA and mucBP leads to a significant decrease in LMD-9 
      adhesion capacity to Caco-2 TC7 cells. A mutation in mucBP gene has also shown a 
      significant decrease in LMD-9 adhesion capacity to HT29-CL.16E cells. However, no 
      difference was observed using HT29-MTX cells. Furthermore, ST LMD-9 and srtA mutant 
      were resistant to BSM up to 3 mM. Contrariwise, no viable bacteria were detected for 
      prtS and mucBP mutants at this concentration. Two conclusions could be drawn. First, 
      SDPs could be involved in the LMD-9 adhesion depending on the cell lines indicating 
      the importance of eukaryotic-cell surface components in adherence. Second, SDPs 
      could contribute to resistance to bile salts probably by maintaining the cell 
      membrane integrity.

AB  - Guided by the inhibitory activities of indole-containing natural products against 
      isocitrate lyase (ICL) from Candida albicans and sortase A (SrtA) from 
      Staphylococcus aureus, a series of compounds structurally analogous to natural 
      products were synthesized. Eight SrtA inhibitors and an ICL inhibitor having higher 
      activities than the natural products were discovered by screening the enzyme 
      inhibitory activities of synthesized compounds. Among the SrtA inhibitors 
      discovered, six exhibited higher activities than p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, which 
      suggests that these compounds have great potential as alternative antibacterial 
      agents.

AB  - Sortase enzymes belong to a family of transpeptidases found in Gram-positive 
      bacteria. Sortase is responsible for the reaction that anchors surface protein 
      virulence factors to the peptidoglycan cell wall of the bacteria. The compound 
      (Z)-3-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) acrylonitrile (DMMA) has previously 
      been reported as a novel sortase inhibitor in vitro, but the in vivo effects of DMMA 
      have not been studied. Here, we evaluated the in vivo effects of DMMA against 
      infection by wild-type and sortase A- and/or sortase B-deficient Staphylococcus 
      aureus in Balb/c mice. With DMMA treatment, survival rates increased and kidney and 
      joint infection rates decreased (p<0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. The rate of 
      kidney infection was significantly reduced in the mice treated with sortase A 
      knock-out S. aureus (p<0.01). These results indicate that by acting as a potent 
      inhibitor of sortase A and moderate inhibitor of sortase B, DMMA can decrease kidney 
      and joint infection rates and reduce mortality in mice infected with S. aureus. 
      These findings suggest that DMMA is a promising therapeutic compound against 
      Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Uncovering Roles of Streptococcus gordonii SrtA-Processed Proteins in the Biofilm 
      Lifestyle.
LID - 10.1128/JB.00544-20 [doi]
LID - e00544-20
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii is a commensal oral organism. Harmless in the oral cavity, S. 
      gordonii is an opportunistic pathogen. S. gordonii adheres to body surfaces using 
      surface adhesive proteins (adhesins), which are critical to subsequent formation of 
      biofilm communities. As in most Gram-positive bacteria, S. gordonii surface proteins 
      containing the C-terminal LPXTG motif cleavage sequence are processed by sortase A 
      (SrtA) to become covalently attached to the cell wall. To characterize the 
      functional diversity and redundancy in the family of SrtA-processed proteins, an S. 
      gordonii DL1 markerless deletion mutant library was constructed of each of the 26 
      putative SrtA-processed proteins. Each library member was evaluated for growth in 
      rich medium, biofilm formation on plastic, saliva and salivary fractions, cell 
      surface hydrophobicity (CSH), hemagglutination, and integration into an ex vivo 
      plaque biofilm community. Library members were compared to the non-SrtA-processed 
      adhesins AbpA and AbpB. While no major growth differences in rich medium were 
      observed, many S. gordonii LPXTG/A proteins impacted biofilm formation on one or 
      more of the substrates. Several mutants showed significant differences in 
      hemagglutination, hydrophobicity, or fitness in the ex vivo plaque model. From the 
      identification of redundant and unique functions in these in vitro and ex vivo 
      systems, functional stratification among the LPXTG/A proteins is apparent.IMPORTANCE 
      S. gordonii interactions with its environment depend on the complement of cell wall 
      proteins. A subset of these cell wall proteins requires processing by the enzyme 
      sortase A (SrtA). The identification of SrtA-processed proteins and their functional 
      characterization will help the community to better understand how S. gordonii 
      engages with its surroundings, including other microbes, integrates into the plaque 
      community, adheres to the tooth surface, and hematogenously disseminates to cause 
      blood-borne infections. This study identified 26 putative SrtA-processed proteins 
      through creation of a markerless deletion mutant library. The library was subject to 
      functional screens that were chosen to better understand key aspects of S. gordonii 
      physiology and pathogenesis.

AB  - Sample solubility is essential for structural studies of proteins by solution NMR. 
      Attachment of a solubility enhancement tag, such as GB1, MBP and thioredoxin, to a 
      target protein has been used for this purpose. However, signal overlap of the tag 
      with the target protein often made the spectral analysis difficult. Here we report a 
      sortase-mediated protein ligation method to eliminate NMR signals arising from the 
      tag by preparing the isotopically labeled target protein attached with the 
      non-labeled GB1 tag at the C-terminus.

AB  - Activated platelets provide a promising target for imaging inflammatory and 
      thrombotic events along with site-specific delivery of a variety of therapeutic 
      agents. Multifunctional protein micelles bearing targeting and therapeutic proteins 
      were now obtained by one-pot transpeptidation using an evolved sortase A. 
      Conjugation to the corona of a single-chain antibody (scFv), which binds to the 
      ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) of activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors, enabled the 
      efficient detection of thrombi. The inhibition of thrombus formation was 
      subsequently accomplished by incorporating the catalytically active domain of 
      thrombomodulin (TM) onto the micelle corona for the local generation of activated 
      protein C, which inhibits the formation of thrombin. An effective strategy has been 
      developed for the preparation of protein micelles that can be targeted to sites of 
      activated platelets with broad potential for treatment of acute thrombotic events.

TI  - Deletion in sortase gene of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt.
PG  - 210-3
AB  - Our previous studies on Streptococcus mutans have demonstrated that surface proteins 
      containing a C-terminal sorting signal, such as surface protein antigen (PAc), 
      glucan-binding protein C (GbpC) and dextranase (Dex), are anchored to the cell wall 
      by a sortase (SrtA). In this study we found that, unlike other strains of S. mutans, 
      strain Ingbritt did not exhibit cell wall-anchoring of PAc, GbpC and Dex. It is 
      speculated that the SrtA of strain Ingbritt did not function in the cell 
      wall-anchoring process of these surface proteins. Sequence analysis revealed a 
      deletion of an 11-bp nucleotide sequence in the srtA gene of strain Ingbritt, 
      resulting in the generation of a new termination codon, resulting in production of 
      an incomplete SrtA enzyme protein. As a result, strain Ingbritt showed a 
      localization change of PAc, GbpC and Dex in the cell, implying that strain Ingbritt 
      loses the biological functions mediated by the cell surface-associated proteins of 
      S. mutans. These results suggest that strain Ingbritt could be less cariogenic than 
      other strains of S. mutans.

TI  - Delivery of Non-Native Cargo into Mammalian Cells Using Anthrax Lethal Toxin.
PG  - 1490-501
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.6b00169 [doi]
AB  - The intracellular delivery of peptide and protein therapeutics is a major challenge 
      due to the plasma membrane, which acts as a barrier between the extracellular 
      environment and the intracellular milieu. Over the past two decades, a nontoxic 
      PA/LFN delivery platform derived from anthrax lethal toxin has been developed for 
      the transport of non-native cargo into the cytosol of cells in order to understand 
      the translocation process through a protective antigen (PA) pore and to probe 
      intracellular biological functions. Enzyme-mediated ligation using sortase A and 
      native chemical ligation are two facile methods used to synthesize these non-native 
      conjugates, inaccessible by recombinant technology. Cargo molecules that translocate 
      efficiently include enzymes from protein toxins, antibody mimic proteins, and 
      peptides of varying lengths and non-natural amino acid compositions. The PA pore has 
      been found to effectively convey over 30 known cargos other than native lethal 
      factor (LF; i.e., non-native) with diverse sequences and functionalities on the LFN 
      transporter protein. All together these studies demonstrated that non-native cargos 
      must adopt an unfolded or extended conformation and contain a suitable charge 
      composition in order to efficiently pass through the PA pore. This review provides 
      insight into design parameters for the efficient delivery of new cargos using PA and 
      LFN.

TI  - Kinetic mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus sortase SrtA.
PG  - 11307-15
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase (SrtA) is a thiol transpeptidase. The enzyme catalyzes 
      a cell wall sorting reaction in which a surface protein with a sorting signal 
      containing a LPXTG motif is cleaved between the threonine and glycine residues. The 
      resulting threonine carboxyl end of this protein is covalently attached to a 
      pentaglycine cross-bridge of peptidoglycan. The transpeptidase activity of sortase 
      has been demonstrated in in vitro reactions between a LPETG-containing peptide and 
      triglycine. When a nucleophile is not available, sortase slowly hydrolyzes the LPETG 
      peptide at the same site. In this study, we have analyzed the steady-state kinetics 
      of these two types of reactions catalyzed by sortase. The kinetic results fully 
      support a ping-pong mechanism in which a common acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed 
      in transpeptidation and hydrolysis. However, each reaction has a distinct 
      rate-limiting step: the formation of the acyl-enzyme in transpeptidation and the 
      hydrolysis of the same acyl-enzyme in the hydrolysis reaction. We have also 
      demonstrated in this study that the nucleophile binding site of S. aureus sortase 
      SrtA is specific for diglycine. While S1' and S2' sites of the enzyme both prefer a 
      glycine residue, the S1' site is exclusively selective for glycine. Lengthening of 
      the polyglycine acceptor nucleophile beyond diglycine does not further enhance the 
      binding and catalysis.

TI  - Gp96 is a receptor for a novel Listeria monocytogenes virulence factor, Vip, a 
      surface protein.
PG  - 2827-38
AB  - By comparative genomics, we have identified a gene of the intracellular pathogen 
      Listeria monocytogenes that encodes an LPXTG surface protein absent from 
      nonpathogenic Listeria species. This gene, vip, is positively regulated by PrfA, the 
      transcriptional activator of the major Listeria virulence factors. Vip is anchored 
      to the Listeria cell wall by sortase A and is required for entry into some mammalian 
      cells. Using a ligand overlay approach, we identified a cellular receptor for Vip, 
      the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperone Gp96 recently shown to interact 
      with TLRs. The Vip-Gp96 interaction is critical for bacterial entry into some cells. 
      Comparative infection studies using oral and intravenous inoculation of 
      nontransgenic and transgenic mice expressing human E-cadherin demonstrated a role 
      for Vip in Listeria virulence, not only at the intestine level but also in late 
      stages of the infectious process. Vip thus appears as a new virulence factor 
      exploiting Gp96 as a receptor for cell invasion and/or signalling events that may 
      interfere with the host immune response in the course of the infection.

TI  - A biosynthetic strategy for re-engineering the Staphylococcus aureus cell wall with 
      non-native small molecules.
PG  - 1147-55
LID - 10.1021/cb100195d [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that has 
      emerged as a major public health threat. Here we report that the cell wall of S. 
      aureus can be covalently re-engineered to contain non-native small molecules. This 
      process makes use of endogenous levels of the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA), 
      which ordinarily functions to incorporate proteins into the bacterial cell wall. 
      Thus, incubation of wild-type bacteria with rationally designed SrtA substrates 
      results in covalent incorporation of functional molecular handles (fluorescein, 
      biotin, and azide) into cell wall peptidoglycan. These conclusions are supported by 
      data obtained through a variety of experimental techniques (epifluorescence and 
      electron microscopy, biochemical extraction, and mass spectrometry), and 
      cell-wall-incorporated azide was exploited as a chemical handle to perform an 
      azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction on the bacterial cell surface. This report 
      represents the first example of cell wall engineering of S. aureus or any other 
      pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria and has the potential for widespread utility.

TI  - Selective Functionalization of Microgels with Enzymes by Sortagging.
PG  - 2859-2869
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00568 [doi]
AB  - Enzyme immobilization has been widely used to improve the stability and 
      recyclability of enzymes in industrial processes. In this work, a sortase-mediated 
      and therefore selective covalent immobilization strategy (sortagging) for enzymes on 
      microgels (GelZyms) was investigated. Aqueous microgels were synthesized from 
      poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)/glycidyl methacrylate (PVCL/GMA) and tagged with the 
      sortase A recognition peptide sequence (LPETG) or its nucleophilic counterpart-tag 
      (GGG). General applicability and selective immobilization were confirmed by 
      subsequent sortagging of five different enzymes (Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA), 
      Yersinia mollaretii phytase (Ym-phytase), Escherichia coli copper efflux oxidase 
      (CueO laccase), cellulase A2, and Bacillus megaterium monooxygenase P450 BM3). The 
      latter was performed directly from the cell lysate to ensure cost-effective 
      immobilization. All five immobilized enzymes were catalytically active and could be 
      recycled (e.g., laccase CueO and monooxygenase P450 BM3 F87A; >55% residual activity 
      after six cycles). Application potential was demonstrated by using CueO decorated 
      microgels for bleaching of the synthetic dye indigo carmine.

PG  - 1714-1719
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00163 [doi]
AB  - Polyproteins, individual protein units joined covalently in tandem, have evolved as 
      a promising tool for measuring the dynamic folding of biomacromolecules in 
      single-molecule force spectroscopy. However, the synthetic routes to prepare 
      polyproteins have been a bottleneck, and urge development of in vitro methods to 
      knit individual protein units covalently into polyprotein. Employing two enzymes of 
      orthogonal functionalities periodically in sequence, we synthesized monodispersed 
      polyproteins on a solid surface. We used Sortase A (SrtA), the enzyme known for 
      sequence specific transpeptidation, to staple protein units covalently through 
      peptide bonds. Exploiting the sequence-specific peptide cleaving ability of TEV 
      protease, we controlled the progress of the reaction to one attachment at a time. 
      Finally, with unique design of the unit proteins we control the orientation of 
      proteins in polyprotein. This simple conjugation has the potential to staple 
      proteins with different functionalities and from different expression systems, in 
      any number in the polyprotein and, above all, via irreversible peptide bonds. 
      Multiple chimeric constructs can also be synthesized with interchangeable protein 
      units.

PG  - 3049-62
LID - 10.1002/pmic.201200144 [doi]
AB  - Sortases catalyze the covalent attachment of proteins with a C-terminal LPxTG motif 
      to the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we show that deletion of the srtA 
      genes of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis resulted in the 
      dislocation of several LPxTG proteins from the cell wall to the growth medium. 
      Nevertheless, proteomics and Western blotting analyses revealed that substantial 
      amounts of the identified proteins remained cell wall bound through noncovalent 
      interactions. The protein dislocation phenotypes of srtA mutants of S. aureus and S. 
      epidermidis were reverted by ectopic expression of srtA genes of either species. 
      Interestingly, S. epidermidis contains a second sortase A, which was previously 
      annotated as ``SrtC.'' Ectopic expression of this SrtC in srtA mutant cells reverted 
      the dislocation of some, but not all, cell wall associated proteins. Similarly, 
      defects in biofilm formation were reverted by ectopic expression of SrtC in some, 
      but not all, tested srtA mutant strains. Finally, overexpression of SrtA resulted in 
      increased levels of biofilm formation in some tested strains. Taken together, these 
      findings show that the substrate specificities of SrtA and SrtC overlap partially, 
      and that sortase levels may be limiting for biofilm formation in some staphylococci.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejmech.2010.05.024 [doi]
AB  - Synthetic methods have been developed for lead Sortase A inhibitors identified from 
      previous studies. Several derivatives of the lead inhibitor were synthesized to 
      derive preliminary structure activity relationships (SAR). Different regions of the 
      lead inhibitor that are critical for the enzyme activity have been determined by 
      systematic SAR studies. The E stereochemistry of the lead compound was found to be 
      critical for its activity. Replacement of the E double bond with Z double bond or a 
      rigid triple bond reduced the enzyme inhibitory activity in most cases. Reduction of 
      the double bond to a C-C single bond resulted in complete loss of activity. Amide 
      carbonyl and NH groups were also found to be crucial for the activity of this class 
      of inhibitors, as well. The morpholine ring oxygen atom was also found to be an 
      important factor for the activity of the lead inhibitor. Preliminary SAR studies led 
      to the identification of compounds with improved enzyme inhibition. The most active 
      compound was found to have an IC(50) value of 58 microM against the enzyme.

TI  - Protective immune responses to a multi-gene DNA vaccine against Staphylococcus 
      aureus.
PG  - 814-24
AB  - To investigate the strategy of using a multivalent polyprotein DNA vaccine against 
      Staphylococcus aureus, a series of plasmids was used to immunize mice followed by 
      infectious challenge. The plasmid vaccines expressed Clumping factor A (Clfa), 
      fibronectin binding protein A (FnBPA) and the enzyme Sortase (Srt) as single 
      proteins or combined as a polyprotein. All animals produced a mixed Th1 and Th2 
      response including functional antigen-specific, mostly IgG2a antibodies, sustained 
      production of IFN-gamma and a predominantly CD8+ T-cell response. Upon challenge 
      with a virulent S. aureus isolate (Sa042), after 21 days, 55% of the multi-gene 
      vaccinated mice survived infection compared to only 15% of the control groups. 
      Vaccinated mice showed no signs of arthritis when challenged with the less virulent 
      "Newman" strain that caused reactive arthritis in the controls. The results suggest 
      that a multi-gene polyprotein-expressing nucleic acid vaccine alone produces a 
      combined Th1 and Th2 response that can contribute to protection against the complex 
      pathogenesis of S. aureus.

TI  - A universal immuno-PCR platform for comparative and ultrasensitive quantification of 
      dual affinity-tagged proteins in complex matrices.
PG  - 5193-6
LID - 10.1039/c2an35857c [doi]
AB  - Protein detection in complex biological fluids and matrices has become a widely 
      diversified field utilizing a number of different technologies. The quantification 
      of target proteins in complex media such as serum remains a challenge for most 
      technologies such as mass spectrometry, ELISA and western blot. Quantitative 
      Immuno-PCR has been heavily used for antigen detection in immunoassays, but 
      minimally so for quantifying affinity-tagged proteins expressed or circulating in 
      complex matrices--despite its high sensitivity and robustness--because it suffers 
      from detrimental background effects arising from its extreme detection power. We 
      report the development of a universal qIPCR-based platform for the reproducible 
      detection of dual affinity-tagged protein analytes in crude complex matrices such as 
      serum and cell culture media or lysates. The system uses a couple of high-affinity 
      antibodies against two affinity tags (GFP and HA) for the detection of dual-tagged 
      proteins. The dual-tagged analyte is immuno-captured by one of its tags, while the 
      second tag is bound by a detection device consisting of a new kind of self-assembled 
      antibody-DNA conjugate. The new qIPCR platform enabled picomolar quantification of 
      dual-tagged sortase in crude serum in 4 h including the PCR step.

TI  - Bis(indole) alkaloids as sortase A inhibitors from the sponge Spongosorites sp.
PG  - 4927-31
AB  - A new bis(indole) alkaloid (9) of the hamacanthin class along with the previously 
      reported compounds of the related structural classes, topsentin class (1-4) and 
      hamacanthin class (5-8), was isolated from the marine sponge Spongosorites sp. and 
      their inhibitory activities toward sortase A (SrtA) that play key roles in cell-wall 
      protein anchoring and virulence in Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. Our studies 
      have identified a series of SrtA inhibitors, providing the basis for further 
      development of potent inhibitors. The preliminary structure-activity relationship, 
      to elucidate the essential structural requirements, has been described. The 
      fibronectin-binding activity data highlight the potential of these compounds for the 
      treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of SrtA activity.

LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.03.042 [doi]
AB  - Protein-based vaccines are considered to be the next-generation of pneumococcal 
      vaccines. Here we evaluated the protection elicited by immunization with recombinant 
      glutamyl tRNA synthetase (Gts), polyamine transport protein D (PotD) and sortase A 
      (SrtA) antigens in preclinical mouse models. In mucosal immunization studies, 
      intranasal immunization with either Gts, PotD or SrtA could significantly reduce 
      pneumococcal nasopharyngeal and lung colonization and significantly increase mice 
      survival times following invasive pneumococcal challenge, and combinations of these 
      antigens could enhance this protection. In systemic immunization studies, 
      intraperitoneal immunization with multiple protein antigens also provided better 
      protection against pneumococcal sepsis caused by different pneumococcal strains. 
      Finally, passive immunization studies showed an additive effect by using multiple 
      anti-sera when compared to single anti-sera. Therefore, a multicomponent 
      protein-based pneumococcal vaccine composed of Gts, PotD or SrtA could confer 
      protection against pneumococcal colonization as well as invasive infections in terms 
      of efficacy of protection and serotype coverage.

TI  - Site-specific protein modification on living cells catalyzed by Sortase.
PG  - 802-7
LID - 10.1002/cbic.200700614 [doi]
AB  - The use of enzymes is a promising approach for site-specific protein modification on 
      living cells owing to their substrate specificity. Herein we describe a general 
      strategy for the site-specific modification of cell surface proteins with synthetic 
      molecules by using Sortase, a transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus. The short 
      peptide tag LPETGG is genetically introduced to the C terminus of the target 
      protein, expressed on the cell surface. Subsequent addition of Sortase and an 
      N-terminal triglycine-containing probe results in the site-specific labeling of the 
      tagged protein. We were successful in the C-terminal-specific labeling of osteoclast 
      differentiation factor (ODF) with a biotin- or fluorophore-containing short peptide 
      on the living cell surface. The labeling reaction occurred efficiently in 
      serum-containing medium, as well as serum-free medium or PBS. The labeled products 
      were detected after incubation for 5 min. In addition, site-specific protein-protein

LID - 488
AB  - Four new peptides were isolated from the culture broths of the marine-derived fungi 
      Aspergillus allahabadii and A. ochraceopetaliformis. Based on the results of 
      chemical and spectroscopic analyses, two compounds (1 and 2) from A. allahabadii 
      were determined to be cyclopentapeptides, while those from A. ochraceopetaliformis 
      were a structurally-related cyclodepsihexapeptide (3) and its linear analog (4). In 
      addition to the presence of a D-amino acid residue, the almost reversed sequence of 
      peptides in 3 and 4, relative to those of the 1 and 2, is notable. These new 
      compounds exhibited moderate inhibition against the enzyme sortase A as well as a 
      weak inhibition against isocitrate lyase (2).

TI  - Convenient Auto-Processing Vector Based on Bamboo Mosaic Virus for Presentation of 
      Antigens Through Enzymatic Coupling.

AB  - We have developed a new binary epitope-presenting CVP platform based on bamboo 
      mosaic virus (BaMV) by using the sortase A (SrtA)-mediated ligation technology. The 
      reconstructed BaMV genome harbors two modifications: 1) a coat protein (CP) with 
      N-terminal extension of the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site plus 
      4 extra glycine (G) residues as the SrtA acceptor; and 2) a TEV protease coding 
      region replacing that of the triple-gene-block proteins. Inoculation of such 
      construct, pKB5G, on Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in the efficient production of 
      filamentous CVPs ready for SrtA-mediated ligation with desired proteins. The second 
      part of the binary platform includes an expression vector for the bacterial 
      production of donor proteins. We demonstrated the applicability of the platform by 
      using the recombinant envelope protein domain III (rEDIII) of Japanese encephalitis 
      virus (JEV) as the antigen. Up to 40% of the BaMV CP subunits in each CVP were 
      loaded with rEDIII proteins in 1 min. The rEDIII-presenting BaMV CVPs (BJLPET5G) 
      could be purified using affinity chromatography. Immunization assays confirmed that 
      BJLPET5G could induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against JEV 
      infections. The binary platform could be adapted as a useful alternative for the 
      development and mass production of vaccine candidates.

AB  - Sortases (Srts) are transpeptidase enzymes that anchor plethora of surface proteins 
      with LPXTG and NPQTN motifs to the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and they are 
      potential targets for the development of anti-infective agents. Despite the 
      existence of numerous inhibitors for Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA), only two 
      inhibitors are known for Staphylococcus aureus SrtB (SaSrtB). Moreover, no study has 
      yet documented the anti-virulence potential of cone snail venom conopeptides against 
      these virulence factors. Here we report M2-conotoxin and contryphan-R as effective 
      inhibitory agents that may competitively block the binding of natural substrates 
      with SaSrtA and SrtB, respectively, via molecular docking and dynamic simulation 
      assays. M2-conotoxin also exhibited strong binding inside the catalytic grooves of 
      distantly related SrtA homologs from Streptococcus mutans (SmSrtA) and Streptococcus 
      agalactiae (SgSrtA). On the other hand, contryphan-R failed to occupy the substrate 
      binding site of closely related Bacillus anthracis SrtB (BaSrtB), but successfully 
      blocked the catalytic site of very divergent C. Perfringens SrtB (CpSrtB). Hence, 
      these naturally existing venom peptides and their mimetics may serve as promising 
      candidates for further development of therapeutically useful anti-infectives for the 
      treatment of infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens having 
      SrtA and SrtB in their enzymatic set.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis unveils survival strategies of Streptococcus parauberis 
      against fish serum.

AB  - Streptococcus parauberis is an important bacterial fish pathogen that causes 
      streptococcosis in a variety of fish species including the olive flounder. Despite 
      its importance in the aquaculture industry, little is known about the survival 
      strategy of S. parauberis in the host. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
      produce genome-wide transcriptome data and identify key factors for the survival of 
      S. parauberis SPOF3K in its host. To this end, S. parauberis SPOF3K was incubated in 
      olive flounder serum and nutrient-enriched media as a control. Although S. 
      parauberis SPOF3K proliferated in both culture conditions, the transcriptomic 
      patterns of the two groups were very different. Interestingly, the expression levels 
      of genes responsible for the replication of an S. parauberis plasmid in the presence 
      of olive flounder serum were higher than those in the absence of olive flounder 
      serum, indicating that this plasmid may play an important role in the survival and 
      proliferation of S. parauberis in the host. Several ATP-binding cassette 
      transporters known to transport organic substrates (e.g., biotin and 
      osmoprotectants) that are vital for bacterial survival in the host were 
      significantly up-regulated in S. parauberis cultured in serum. In addition, groEL, 
      dnaK operon, and members of the clp protease family, which are known to play 
      important roles in response to various stressors, were up-regulated in S. parauberis 
      incubated in serum, thus limiting damage and facilitating cellular recovery. 
      Moreover, important virulence factors including the hyaluronic acid capsule (has 
      operon), sortase A (srtA), C5a peptidase (scp), and peptidoglycan 
      O-acetyltransferase (oatA) were significantly upregulated in S. paraubers in serum. 
      These results indicate that S. paraubers can resist and evade the humoral immune 
      responses of fish. The transcriptomic data obtained in this study provide a better 
      understanding of the mode of action of S. parauberis in fish.

AB  - Strangles, which is caused by Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi), is one 
      of the most prevalent equine infectious diseases with worldwide distribution and 
      leads to serious economic loss in the horse industry. Sortase A (srtA) is a 
      transpeptidase that anchors multiple virulence-associated surface proteins to the 
      cell surface of S. equi. srtA plays a major role in S. equi infection and 
      colonization of the host cell. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of 
      srtA mutation on the phagocytic activity and immunogenicity of S. equi. The 
      point-mutated recombinant sortases, including srtA-HT1112 (I88V), srtA-5012 (R147G), 
      and srtA-ZZM17 (control), were expressed, purified, and used to immunize the mouse 
      models. Phagocytic activity was assessed using equine polymorphonuclear cells, 
      whereas opsonophagocytic function and adherence inhibition were measured using the 
      antiserum of these mutants. Mouse serum antibody, bacterial load, and weight gain 
      were also measured. The srtA-HT1112 (I88V) mutant showed significantly enhanced 
      antiphagocytic capability, and its antiserum exhibited increased adherence 
      inhibition activity. In addition, the srtA-HT1112 (I88V) mutant presented the 
      highest lung bacterial load and lowest protection rate (50%) after the challenge 
      with S. equi ZZM17. The srtA-5012 (R147G) mutant exhibited a high IgG2a level and 
      protection rate (62.5%-75%) and the lowest lung bacterial load. These results 
      indicate that the I88V mutation is associated with a high antiphagocytic activity, 
      whereas R147G mutation is associated with the decreased lung bacterial load. Our 
      findings may be useful for the evaluation and development of vaccines.

TI  - Efficient enzymatic cyclization of an inhibitory cystine knot-containing peptide.
PG  - 2202-12
LID - 10.1002/bit.25993 [doi]
AB  - Disulfide-rich peptides isolated from cone snails are of great interest as drug 
      leads due to their high specificity and potency toward therapeutically relevant ion 
      channels and receptors. They commonly contain the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif 
      comprising three disulfide bonds forming a knotted core. Here we report the 
      successful enzymatic backbone cyclization of an ICK-containing peptide κ-PVIIA, a 
      27-amino acid conopeptide from Conus purpurascens, using a mutated version of the 
      bacterial transpeptidase, sortase A. Although a slight loss of activity was observed 
      compared to native κ-PVIIA, cyclic κ-PVIIA is a functional peptide that inhibits the 
      Shaker voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel. Molecular modeling suggests that the 
      decrease in potency may be related to the loss of crucial, but previously 
      unidentified electrostatic interactions between the N-terminus of the peptide and 
      the Shaker channel. This hypothesis was confirmed by testing an N-terminally 
      acetylated κ-PVIIA, which shows a similar decrease in activity. We also investigated 
      the conformational dynamics and hydrogen bond network of cyc-PVIIA, both of which 
      are important factors to be considered for successful cyclization of peptides. We 
      found that cyc-PVIIA has the same conformational dynamics, but different hydrogen 
      bond network compared to those of κ-PVIIA. The ability to efficiently cyclize ICK 
      peptides using sortase A will enable future protein engineering for this class of 
      peptides and may help in the development of novel therapeutic molecules. Biotechnol.

TI  - Mechanism for sortase localization and the role of sortase localization in efficient 
      pilus assembly in Enterococcus faecalis.
PG  - 3237-47
LID - 10.1128/JB.01837-08 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenic streptococci and enterococci primarily rely on the conserved secretory 
      (Sec) pathway for the translocation and secretion of virulence factors out of the 
      cell. Since many secreted virulence factors in gram-positive organisms are 
      subsequently attached to the bacterial cell surface via sortase enzymes, we sought 
      to investigate the spatial relationship between secretion and cell wall attachment 
      in Enterococcus faecalis. We discovered that sortase A (SrtA) and sortase C (SrtC) 
      are colocalized with SecA at single foci in the enterococcus. The SrtA-processed 
      substrate aggregation substance accumulated in single foci when SrtA was deleted, 
      implying a single site of secretion for these proteins. Furthermore, in the absence 
      of the pilus-polymerizing SrtC, pilin subunits also accumulate in single foci. 
      Proteins that localized to single foci in E. faecalis were found to share a 
      positively charged domain flanking a transmembrane helix. Mutation or deletion of 
      this domain in SrtC abolished both its retention at single foci and its function in 
      efficient pilus assembly. We conclude that this positively charged domain can act as 
      a localization retention signal for the focal compartmentalization of membrane 
      proteins.

      specialized substrates, bulky fusion tags, low yields, and extra purification steps 
      to achieve the desired conjugate. Staphylococcus aureus sortase A and its engineered 
      variants are used to attach oligoglycine derivatives to the C-terminus of proteins 
      expressed with a minimal LPXTG tag. This strategy has been used extensively for 
      bioconjugation in vitro and for protein-protein conjugation in living cells. Here we 
      show that an enzyme variant recently engineered for higher activity on oligoglycine 
      has promiscuous activity that allows proteins to be tagged using a diverse array of 
      small, commercially available amines, including several bioorthogonal functional 
      groups. This technique can also be carried out in living Escherichia coli, enabling 
      simple, inexpensive production of chemically functionalized proteins with no 
      additional purification steps.

AB  - A wealth of knowledge has been accumulated on ribosomal synthesis of macrocyclic 
      peptides in the past decade. In nature, backbone cyclization of the translated 
      linear peptides is generally catalyzed by specific enzymes, giving them peptidase 
      resistance, thermodynamic stability and various other physiological activities. Due 
      to these biochemical traits, backbone cyclic peptides have become an attractive 
      resource for the discovery of drug leads. Recently, various new methodologies have 
      also been established to generate man-made cyclic peptides. Here, we describe the 
      biosynthetic mechanisms of naturally occurring backbone macrocyclic peptides 
      focusing on cyclotides, sunflower trypsin inhibitors (SFTIs) and cyanobactins as 
      well as several new emerging methodologies, such as sortase mediated ligation, 
      protein splicing method and genetic code reprogramming.

AB  - Sortase A is a transpeptidase that cleaves at a pentapeptide-motif and subsequently 
      transfers the acyl component to a nucleophile containing N-terminal oligoglycines. 
      We investigate the reaction conditions of the sortase-mediated ligation and 
      demonstrate a useful application by the synthesis of a peptide nucleic 
      acid-cell-penetrating peptide chimera, the reaction equilibrium of which can be 
      shifted in favor of the product by dialyzing out the low molecular weight byproduct. 
      The synthesized conjugate exhibits dose-dependent antisense activity.

AB  - The biophysical stability is an important parameter for protein activity both in 
      vivo and in vitro. Here we propose a method to analyse thermal melting of protein 
      domains in lysates: Fast parallel proteolysis (FASTpp). Combining unfolding by a 
      temperature gradient in a thermal cycler with simultaneous proteolytic cleavage of 
      the unfolded state, we probed stability of single domains in lysates. We validated 
      FASTpp on proteins from 10 kDa to 240 kDa and monitored stabilisation and coupled 
      folding and binding upon interaction with small-molecule ligands. Within a total 
      reaction time of approximately 1 min, we probed subtle stability differences of 
      point mutations with high sensitivity and in agreement with data obtained by 
      intrinsic protein fluorescence. We anticipate a wide range of applications of FASTpp 
      in biomedicine and protein engineering as it requires only standard laboratory 
      equipment.

TI  - [Enzymatic cyclization of peptides using immobilized sortase A].
PG  - 627-32
AB  - Peptide cyclization, a pivotal approach to modifying linear precursors of proteins 
      and pepticles, has been used to enhance their biological activities and serum 
      stabilities. Recently, sortase A (SrtA) from Staphyloccus aureus becomes a promising 
      new technology for efficiently incorporating site specific modifications into 
      proteins, conjugating the cell surface and cyclizing the linear peptides. In this 
      study, we constructed two recombinant expression systems, one with chitin binding 
      domain and the other with six-histidine tag and chitin binding domain on the 
      N-terminal of SrtA, separately. The results of enzymatic kinetics indicate that the 
      two recombinant tags do not impair the transpeptidase activity of SrtA compared with 
      the standard reaction reported under the same reaction condition. The two 
      synthesized peptides with N-ternimal three glycines and C-terminal penta-amino acid 
      motif, LPETG, were cyclized using immobilized and recycled SrtA. The SrtA-based 
      cyclization promises to represent a simple method for easy and efficient enzymatic 
      synthesis of large cyclic peptides.

TI  - Recruitment of the major vault protein by InlK: a Listeria monocytogenes strategy to 
      avoid autophagy.
PG  - e1002168
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002168 [doi]
LID - e1002168
AB  - L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterium responsible for 
      listeriosis. It is able to invade, survive and replicate in phagocytic and 
      non-phagocytic cells. The infectious process at the cellular level has been 
      extensively studied and many virulence factors have been identified. Yet, the role 
      of InlK, a member of the internalin family specific to L. monocytogenes, remains 
      unknown. Here, we first show using deletion analysis and in vivo infection, that 
      InlK is a bona fide virulence factor, poorly expressed in vitro and well expressed 
      in vivo, and that it is anchored to the bacterial surface by sortase A. We then 
      demonstrate by a yeast two hybrid screen using InlK as a bait, validated by pulldown 
      experiments and immunofluorescence analysis that intracytosolic bacteria via an 
      interaction with the protein InlK interact with the Major Vault Protein (MVP), the 
      main component of cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteic particules named vaults. Although 
      vaults have been implicated in several cellular processes, their role has remained 
      elusive. Our analysis demonstrates that MVP recruitment disguises intracytosolic 
      bacteria from autophagic recognition, leading to an increased survival rate of InlK 
      over-expressing bacteria compared to InlK(-) bacteria. Together these results reveal 
      that MVP is hijacked by L. monocytogenes in order to counteract the autophagy 
      process, a finding that could have major implications in deciphering the cellular 
      role of vault particles.

PG  - 8038-41
LID - 10.1021/ja302082d [doi]
AB  - In this report we present a method to identify functional artificial lantipeptides. 
      In vitro translation coupled with an enzyme-free protocol for posttranslational 
      modification allows preparation of more than 10(11) different lanthionine containing 
      peptides. This diversity can be searched for functional molecules using 
      mRNA-lantipeptide display. We validated this approach by isolating binders toward 
      Sortase A, a transamidase which is required for virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. 
      The interaction of selected lantipeptides with Sortase A is highly dependent on the 
      presence of a (2S,6R)-lanthionine in the peptide and an active conformation of the 
      protein.

TI  - Convenient method of producing cyclic single-chain Fv antibodies by 
      split-intein-mediated protein ligation and chaperone co-expression.
PG  - 257-263
LID - 10.1093/jb/mvaa042 [doi]
AB  - Single-chain Fv (scFv) is a recombinant antibody in which the variable regions of 
      the heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) are connected by a short flexible 
      polypeptide linker. Compared with monoclonal antibodies, scFvs have the advantages 
      of low-cost production using Escherichia coli and easy genetic manipulation. ScFvs 
      are, therefore, regarded as useful modules for producing next-generation medical 
      antibodies. The practical use of scFvs has been limited due to their aggregation 
      propensity mediated by interchain VH-VL interactions. To overcome this problem, we 
      recently reported a cyclic scFv whose N-terminus and C-terminus were connected by 
      sortase A-mediated ligation. Preparation of cyclic scFv is, however, a 
      time-consuming process. To accelerate the application study of cyclic scFv, we 
      developed a method to produce cyclic scFv by the combined use of a protein ligation 
      technique based on protein trans-splicing reaction (PTS) by split intein and a 
      chaperone co-expression system. This method allows for the preparation of active 
      cyclic scFv from the cytoplasm of E. coli. The present method was applied to the 
      production of cyclic 73MuL9-scFv, a GA-pyridine antibody, as a kind of advanced 
      glycation end-product. These findings are expected to evoke further application 
      study of cyclic scFv.

AB  - We report a site-specific, sortase-mediated ligation to immobilize proteins 
      layer-by-layer on a gold surface. Recombinant fluorescent proteins with a Sortase A 
      recognition tag at the C-terminus were immobilized on peptide-modified gold 
      surfaces. We used two sortases with different substrate specificities (Streptococcus 
      pyogenes Sortase A and Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A) to immobilize layers of GFP 
      and mCherry site-specifically on the gold surface. Surfaces were characterized using 
      fluorescence and atomic force microscopy after immobilizing each layer of protein. 
      Fluorescent micrographs showed that both protein immobilization on the modified gold 
      surface and protein oligomerization are sortase-dependent. AFM images showed that 
      either homogenous protein monolayers or layers of protein oligomers can be generated 
      using appropriately tagged substrate proteins. Using Sortase A variants with 
      orthogonal peptide substrate specificities, site-specific immobilization of 
      appropriately tagged GFP onto a layer of immobilized mCherry was achieved without 
      disruption of the underlying protein layer.

TI  - Inhibition of sortase-mediated Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to fibronectin via 
      fibronectin-binding protein by sortase inhibitors.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - The sortase enzymes are a family of Gram-positive transpeptidases responsible for 
      anchoring surface protein virulence factors to the peptidoglycan cell wall layer. In 
      Staphylococcus aureus, deletion of the sortase isoforms results in marked reduction 
      in virulence and infection potential, making it an important antivirulence target. 
      Recombinant sortase A (SrtA) and sortase B (SrtB) were incubated with peptide 
      substrate containing either the LPETG or NPQTN motifs. 
      (Z)-3-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) acrylonitrile, 
      beta-sitosterol-3-O-glucopyranoside, berberine chloride, and psammaplin A1 showed 
      potent inhibitory activity against SrtA and SrtB. These compounds also exhibited 
      potent inhibitory activity against S. aureus cell adhesion to fibronectin. The 
      fibronectin-binding activity data highlight the potential of these compounds for the 
      treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of sortase activity.

AB  - We produced a functional polymer whose framework comprised transthyretin (TTR) 
      amyloid fibrils. In order to immobilize functional molecules onto the amyloid 
      fibrils, transpeptidase sortase A (srtA), which catalyzes the covalent binding of 
      LPXTG with polyglycine, was employed. After the preparation of the amyloid fibril of 
      LPETGG-tagged TTR, immobilization of Gly5-fused GFP on the amyloid fibrils by 
      srtA-mediated transpeptidation was carried out. SrtA recognized the amyloid fibrils 
      consisting of an LPETGG-tagged TTR variant (L55P) as a good substrate, resulting in 
      successful preparation of a GFP-immobilized amyloid. Intriguingly, the replacement 
      of GFP with Gly5-fused luciferase was confirmed when the GFP-immobilized amyloids 
      were mixed with Gly5-luciferase in the presence of srtA. Thus, it was found that 
      functional molecules covalently immobilized on amyloid could be detached and 
      substituted with other tagged molecules by using srtA.

AB  - Unstable and low-abundance protein complexes represent a large family of transient 
      protein complexes that are difficult to characterize, even by means of 
      high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. A method to assign the NMR signals of these 
      unstable complexes through a combination of selective isotope labeling of amino 
      acids in a protein and site-specific labeling the protein with a paramagnetic tag is 
      presented herein. By using this method, the resonances of unstable thioester 
      intermediate complex (lifetime <5 h and highest concentration ≈20 μm) generated by 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A and its peptide substrate under a real-time reaction 
      have been assigned.

AB  - The inhibitory activity of Coptis chinensis rhizome-derived material was evaluated 
      against sortase, a bacterial surface protein anchoring transpeptidase, from 
      Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538p and compared to that of four commercially available 
      isoquinoline alkaloids. The biologically active constituent of C. chinensis extract

      analysis. The isolate was a potent inhibitor of sortase, with an IC50 value of 8.7 
      microg/ml and had antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria with a 
      minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the range of 50-400 microg/ml. Among the 
      four isoquinoline alkaloids tested, berberine chloride had strong inhibitory 
      activity. These results indicate that berberine is a possible candidate for the 
      development of a bacterial sortase inhibitor.

AB  - In recent years, nanobodies have emerged as ideal imaging agents for molecular 
      imaging. Molecular nanobody imaging combines the specificity of nanobodies with the 
      sensitivity of state-of-the-art molecular imaging modalities, such as positron 
      emission tomography (PET). Given that modifications of nanobodies alter their 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), the engineering strategies that combine nanobodies with 
      radionuclides determine the effectiveness, reliability, and safety of the molecular 
      imaging probes. In this review, we introduce conjugation strategies that have been 
      applied to nanobodies, including random conjugation, (99m)Tc tricarbonyl chemistry, 
      sortase A-mediated site-specific conjugation, maleimide-cysteine chemistry, and 
      click chemistries. We also summarize the latest advances in nanobody tracers, 
      emphasizing their preclinical and clinical use. In addition, we elaborate on 
      nanobody-based near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and image-guided surgery.

TI  - Enzymatic single-chain antibody tagging: a universal approach to targeted molecular 
      imaging and cell homing in cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 365-73

AB  - RATIONALE: Antibody-targeted delivery of imaging agents can enhance the sensitivity 
      and accuracy of current imaging techniques. Similarly, homing of effector cells to 
      disease sites increases the efficacy of regenerative cell therapy while reducing the 
      number of cells required. Currently, targeting can be achieved via chemical 
      conjugation to specific antibodies, which typically results in the loss of antibody 
      functionality and in severe cell damage. An ideal conjugation technique should 
      ensure retention of antigen-binding activity and functionality of the targeted 
      biological component. OBJECTIVE: To develop a biochemically robust, highly 
      reproducible, and site-specific coupling method using the Staphylococcus aureus 
      sortase A enzyme for the conjugation of a single-chain antibody (scFv) to 
      nanoparticles and cells for molecular imaging and cell homing in cardiovascular 
      diseases. This scFv specifically binds to activated platelets, which play a pivotal 
      role in thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 
      conjugation procedure involves chemical and enzyme-mediated coupling steps. The scFv 
      was successfully conjugated to iron oxide particles (contrast agents for magnetic 
      resonance imaging) and to model cells. Conjugation efficiency ranged between 50% and 
      70%, and bioactivity of the scFv after coupling was preserved. The targeting of 
      scFv-coupled cells and nanoparticles to activated platelets was strong and specific 
      as demonstrated in in vitro static adhesion assays, in a flow chamber system, in 
      mouse intravital microscopy, and in in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of mouse 
      carotid arteries. CONCLUSIONS: This unique biotechnological approach provides a 
      versatile and broadly applicable tool for procuring targeted regenerative cell 
      therapy and targeted molecular imaging in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases 
      and beyond.

TI  - Site-specific cross-linking of proteins to DNA via a new bioorthogonal approach 
      employing oxime ligation.
PG  - 6296-6299
LID - 10.1039/c8cc01300d [doi]
AB  - DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are super-bulky DNA adducts induced by common 
      chemotherapeutic agents, reactive oxygen species, and aldehydes, and also formed 
      endogenously as part of epigenetic regulation. Despite their presence in most cells 
      and tissues, the biological effects of DPCs are poorly understood due to the 
      difficulty of constructing site-specific DNA-protein conjugates. In the present 
      work, a new approach of conjugating proteins to DNA using oxime ligation was used to 
      generate model DPCs structurally analogous to lesions formed in cells. In our 
      approach, proteins and peptides containing an unnatural oxy-Lys amino acid were 
      cross-linked to DNA strands functionalized with 5-formyl-dC or 
      7-(2-oxoethyl)-7-deaza-dG residues using oxime ligation. The conjugation reaction 
      was site-specific with respect to both protein and DNA, provided excellent reaction 
      yields, and formed stable DPCs amenable to biological evaluation.

TI  - A coagulase-negative and non-haemolytic strain of Staphylococcus aureus for

PG  - ftv042
LID - ftv042 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femspd/ftv042 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) is a cysteine transpeptidase and virulence factor from 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) that catalyses the attachment and display of 
      surface proteins on the cell wall, thereby mediating bacterial adhesion to host 
      tissues, host-cell entry and evasion of the immune response. As a result, SrtA has 
      become an important target in the development of therapies for S. aureus infections. 
      In this study, we used the new reference strain S. aureus Newman D2C to investigate 
      the role of SrtA in a murine model of bloodstream infection, when the impact of 
      coagulase and haemolysin is excluded. The results suggested that deletion of SrtA 
      reduced the bacterial burden on the heart, liver and kidneys by blunting the host 
      proinflammatory cytokine response at an early point in infection. Kidneys, but not 
      heart or liver, formed abscesses on the sixth day following non-lethal infection, 
      and this effect was diminished by SrtA mutation. These findings indicate that SrtA 
      is a determining virulence factor in lethality and formation of renal abscesses in 
      mice followed by S. aureus bloodstream infection. We have thus established a 
      convenient in vitro and mouse model for developing SrtA-targeted therapeutic 
      strategies.

      Assays.
PG  - 12666-12669
LID - 10.1002/anie.201805034 [doi]
AB  - Covalent surface immobilization of proteins for binding assays is typically 
      performed non-specifically via lysine residues. However, receptors that either have 
      lysines near their binding pockets, or whose presence at the sensor surface is 
      electrostatically disfavoured, can be hard to probe. To overcome these limitations 
      and to improve the homogeneity of surface functionalization, we adapted and 
      optimized three different enzymatic coupling strategies (4'-phosphopantetheinyl 
      transferase, sortase A, and asparaginyl endopeptidase) for biolayer interferometry 
      surface modification. All of these enzymes can be used to site-specifically and 
      covalently ligate proteins of interest via short recognition sequences. The enzymes 
      function under mild conditions and thus immobilization does not affect the 
      receptors' functionality. We successfully employed this enzymatic surface 
      functionalization approach to study the binding kinetics of two different 
      receptor-ligand pairs.

PG  - 160-166
LID - 10.1007/s11596-018-1860-y [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to study whether the Sortase A (srtA) gene helps mediate 
      coaggregation and co-adherence between Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and other 
      salivary bacteria. S. mutans UA159 and srtA-deficient mutant served as "bait" in 
      classical co-aggregation assays and membrane-based co-adherence assays were used to 
      examine interactions of S. mutans with Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), 
      Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis), Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii), Streptococcus 
      sanguis (S. sanguis), Actinomyces naeslundii (A. naeslundii) and Lactobacillus. 
      Co-adherence assays were also performed using unfractionated saliva from healthy 
      individuals. Co-adhering partners of S. mutans were sensitively detected using 
      polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Both 
      UA159 and its srtA-deficient mutant bound to F. nucleatum but not to any of the 
      other five salivary bacteria. The srtA-deficient mutant showed lower co-adherence 
      with F.nucleatum. The two S. mutans strains also showed similar co-adherence 
      profiles against unfractionated salivary bacteria, except that UA159 S. mutans but 
      not the srtA-deficient bound to a Neisseria sp. under the same conditions. Deleting 
      srtA reduces the ability of S. mutans to bind to F.nucleatum, but it does not appear 
      to significantly affect the binding profile of S. mutans to bulk salivary bacteria.

TI  - Observing selected domains in multi-domain proteins via sortase-mediated ligation 
      and NMR spectroscopy.
PG  - 3-7
LID - 10.1007/s10858-010-9464-2 [doi]
AB  - NMR spectroscopy has distinct advantages for providing insight into protein 
      structures, but faces significant resolution challenges as protein size increases. 
      To alleviate such resonance overlap issues, the ability to produce segmentally 
      labeled proteins is beneficial. Here we show that the S. aureus transpeptidase 
      sortase A can be used to catalyze the ligation of two separately expressed domains 
      of the same protein, MecA (B. subtilis). The yield of purified, segmentally labeled 
      MecA protein conjugate is approximately 40%. The resultant HSQC spectrum obtained 
      from this domain-labeled conjugate demonstrates successful application of sortase A 
      for segmental labeling of multi-domain proteins for solution NMR study.

TI  - Impact of Lactobacillus plantarum sortase on target protein sorting, 
      gastrointestinal persistence, and host immune response modulation.
PG  - 502-9
LID - 10.1128/JB.01321-12 [doi]
AB  - Sortases are transpeptidases that couple surface proteins to the peptidoglycan of 
      Gram-positive bacteria, and several sortase-dependent proteins (SDPs) have been 
      demonstrated to be crucial for the interactions of pathogenic and nonpathogenic 
      bacteria with their hosts. Here, we studied the role of sortase A (SrtA) in 
      Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, a model Lactobacillus for probiotic organisms. An 
      isogenic srtA deletion derivative was constructed which did not show residual SrtA 
      activity. DNA microarray-based transcriptome analysis revealed that the srtA 
      deletion had only minor impact on the full-genome transcriptome of L. plantarum, 
      while the expression of SDP-encoding genes remained completely unaffected. Mass 
      spectrometry analysis of the bacterial cell surface proteome, which was assessed by 
      trypsinization of intact bacterial cells and by LiCl protein extraction, revealed 
      that SrtA is required for the appropriate subcellular location of specific SDPs and 
      for their covalent coupling to the cell envelope, respectively. We further found 
      that SrtA deficiency did not affect the persistence and/or survival of L. plantarum 
      in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. In addition, an in vitro immature dendritic 
      cell (iDC) assay revealed that the removal of surface proteins by LiCl strongly 
      affected the proinflammatory signaling properties of the SrtA-deficient strain but 
      not of the wild type, which suggests a role of SDPs in host immune response 
      modulation.

      Conjugates.
PG  - 2790-2798
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00548 [doi]
AB  - Antibody-DNA conjugates are powerful tools for DNA-assisted protein analysis. 
      Growing usage of these methods demands efficient production of high-quality 
      conjugates. We developed an easy and fast synthesis route yielding covalent 
      antibody-DNA conjugates with a defined conjugation site and low batch-to-batch 
      variability. We utilize the Z domain from protein A, containing the unnatural amino 
      acid 4-benzoylphenylalanine (BPA) for photoaffinity labeling of the antibodies' Fc 
      region. Z(xBPA) domains are C-terminally modified with triple-glycine 
      (G(3))-modified DNA-oligonucleotides via enzymatic Sortase A coupling. We show 
      reliable modification of the most commonly used IgG's. To prove our conjugates' 
      functionality, we detected antibody-antigen binding events in an assay called 
      Droplet Barcode Sequencing for Protein analysis (DBS-Pro). It confirms not only 
      retained functionality for both conjugate parts but also the potential of using 
      DBS-Pro for quantifying protein abundances. As intermediates are easily storable and 
      our approach is modular, it offers a convenient strategy for screening various 
      antibody-DNA conjugates using the same starting material.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing threats of antibiotic resistance urge the need for 
      developing new approaches to combat bacterial infections including those caused by 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Unlike conventional antibiotics that aim to kill 
      bacteria or inhibit their growth, targeting bacterial virulence may be a promising 
      alternative approach, which imposes less selective pressure for antibiotic 
      resistance in future generations. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to provide a systematic 
      review about developing high-throughput screening (HTS) strategies for the 
      identification of inhibitors targeting virulence of S. aureus. We also describe an 
      overview of virulence regulatory pathways for potential antivirulence targets. 
      METHODS: We focus on five potential targets or target families, including agr quorum 
      sensing system, SarA/MgrA protein family, sortase A, Clp protease and 
      eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr phosphatase (Stp1). For each target, we introduce its role 
      in virulence regulation, summarize the HTS approaches that are used to identify 
      novel anti-virulence inhibitors, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of 
      these strategies. CONCLUSION: The discovery of anti-virulence inhibitors via HTS 
      underlines the promising potential of anti-virulence therapy for S. aureus. The 
      development of HTS strategies can facilitate the identification of novel 
      anti-virulence inhibitors for combating S. aureus infection, and may also advance 
      our understanding on virulence regulation in S. aureus.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) control over the placement of bioactive cues is fundamental 
      to understand cell guidance and develop engineered tissues. Two-photon patterning 
      (2PP) provides such placement at micro- to millimeter scale, but nonspecific 
      interactions between proteins and functionalized extracellular matrices (ECMs) 
      restrict its use. Here, a 2PP system based on nonfouling hydrophilic photocages and 
      Sortase A (SA)-based enzymatic coupling is presented, which offers unprecedented 
      orthogonality and signal-to-noise ratio in both inert hydrogels and complex 
      mammalian matrices. Improved photocaged peptide synthesis and protein 
      functionalization protocols with broad applicability are introduced. Importantly, 
      the method enables 2PP in a single step in the presence of fragile biomolecules and 
      cells, and is compatible with time-controlled growth factor presentation. As a 
      corollary, the guidance of axons through 3D-patterned nerve growth factor (NGF) 
      within brain-mimetic ECMs is demonstrated. The approach allows for the interrogation 
      of the role of complex signaling molecules in 3D matrices, thus helping to better 
      understand biological guidance in tissue development and regeneration.

TI  - Bacterial inclusion bodies as potential synthetic devices for pathogen recognition 
      and a therapeutic substance release.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1475-2859-12-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesins of pathogens recognise the glycans on the host cell and mediate 
      adherence. They are also crucial for determining the tissue preferences of 
      pathogens. Currently, glyco-nanomaterials provide potential tool for antimicrobial 
      therapy. We demonstrate that properly glyco-tailored inclusion bodies can 
      specifically bind pathogen adhesins and release therapeutic substances. RESULTS: In 
      this paper, we describe the preparation of tailored inclusion bodies via the 
      conjugation of indicator protein aggregated to form inclusion bodies with soluble 
      proteins. Whereas the indicator protein represents a remedy, the soluble proteins 
      play a role in pathogen recognition. For conjugation, glutaraldehyde was used as 
      linker. The treatment of conjugates with polar lysine, which was used to inactivate 
      the residual glutaraldehyde, inhibited unwanted hydrophobic interactions between 
      inclusion bodies. The tailored inclusion bodies specifically interacted with the 
      SabA adhesin from Helicobacter pylori aggregated to form inclusion bodies that were 
      bound to the sialic acids decorating the surface of human erythrocytes. We also 
      tested the release of indicator proteins from the inclusion bodies using sortase A 
      and Ssp DNAB intein self-cleaving modules, respectively. Sortase A released proteins 
      in a relatively short period of time, whereas the intein cleavage took several 
      weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The tailored inclusion bodies are promising "nanopills" for 
      biomedical applications. They are able to specifically target the pathogen, while a 
      self-cleaving module releases a soluble remedy. Various self-cleaving modules can be 
      enabled to achieve the diverse pace of remedy release.

PG  - 1746-1751
LID - 10.1002/chem.201804889 [doi]
AB  - Efficient and reliable methods for the generation of bioactive papers are of growing 
      interest in relation to point-of-care testing devices that do not require extensive 
      analytical equipment. Herein, we report the immobilization of functional proteins on 
      paper fibers using a modular chemoenzymatic approach. The synthetic strategy relies 
      on a combination of highly efficient spatially controllable photo-triggered 
      cycloaddition followed by site-specific sortase A-catalyzed transamidation. This 
      site-directed and regiospecific method has allowed unidirectional and covalent 
      immobilization of several proteins displaying different functional properties, with 
      ramifications for application in paper-based diagnostics.

AB  - We report the first method of enzyme protection enabling the production of partially 
      shielded enzymes capable of processing substrates as large as proteins. We show that 
      partially shielded sortase retains its transpeptidase activity and can perform 
      bioconjugation reactions on antibodies. Moreover, a partially shielded trypsin is 
      shown to outperform its soluble counterpart in terms of proteolytic kinetics. 
      Remarkably, partial enzyme shielding results in a drastic increase in temporal 
      stability of the enzyme.

AB  - A novel and versatile peptide-based bio-logic system capable of regulating cell

      regulatory circuit was developed to analyze the expression profile of cell-secreted 
      protein biomarkers and trigger cancer-cell-specific apoptosis.

TI  - Selection of Promising Novel Fragment Sized S. aureus SrtA Noncovalent Inhibitors 
      Based on QSAR and Docking Modeling Studies.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26247677 [doi]
LID - 7677
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) of Staphylococcus aureus has been identified as a promising target 
      to a new type of antivirulent drugs, and therefore, the design of lead molecules 
      with a low nanomolar range of activity and suitable drug-like properties is 
      important. In this work, we aimed at identifying new fragment-sized starting points 
      to design new noncovalent S. aureus SrtA inhibitors by making use of the dedicated 
      molecular motif, 5-arylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate, which has been previously shown to 
      be significant for covalent binding SrtA inhibitors. To this end, an in silico 
      approach combining QSAR and molecular docking studies was used. The known SrtA 
      inhibitors from the ChEMBL database with diverse scaffolds were first employed to 
      derive descriptors and interpret their significance and correlation to activity. 
      Then, the classification and regression QSAR models were built, which were used for 
      rough ranking of the virtual library of the synthetically feasible compounds 
      containing the dedicated motif. Additionally, the virtual library compounds were 
      docked into the "activated" model of SrtA (PDB:2KID). The consensus ranking of the 
      virtual library resulted in the most promising structures, which will be subject to 
      further synthesis and experimental testing in order to establish new fragment-like 
      molecules for further development into antivirulent drugs.

TI  - In vitro sortagging of an antibody fab fragment: overcoming unproductive reactions 
      of sortase with water and lysine side chains.
PG  - 1774-80
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201100002 [doi]
AB  - Sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus attracts growing interest for its use in 
      biotechnological protein modification. This enzyme binds to a short signal sequence 
      at the C terminus of a target protein, cleaves it by formation of an acyl-enzyme 
      intermediate, and subsequently attaches an oligoglycine with a peptide bond. In this 
      work, we explored its usability for the modification of the L19 Fab fragment 
      (specific for fibronectin ED-B), a promising candidate for antibody-based cancer 
      therapy. The Fab fragment was expressed with a sortase signal sequence attached to 
      its light chain, and was successfully modified with a fluorescent oligoglycine probe 
      in good yield. Our interest focused on performance under conditions of limited 
      oligoglycine concentrations. Two unproductive side reactions of sortase were 
      observed. The first was hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate; in the second, 
      sortase accepted the ε-amino group of lysine as substrate, thereby resulting in 
      polypeptide crosslinking. In case of the L19 Fab fragment, it led to the covalent 
      connection of the heavy and light chains. Both side reactions were effectively 
      suppressed by sufficient concentrations of the oligoglycine probe.

TI  - Assembly of minicellulosomes on the surface of Bacillus subtilis.
PG  - 4849-58
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02599-10 [doi]
AB  - To cost-efficiently produce biofuels, new methods are needed to convert 
      lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. One promising approach is to 
      degrade biomass using cellulosomes, which are surface-displayed 
      multicellulase-containing complexes present in cellulolytic Clostridium and 
      Ruminococcus species. In this study we created cellulolytic strains of Bacillus 
      subtilis that display one or more cellulase enzymes. Proteins containing the 
      appropriate cell wall sorting signal are covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan by 
      coexpressing them with the Bacillus anthracis sortase A (SrtA) transpeptidase. This 
      approach was used to covalently attach the Cel8A endoglucanase from Clostridium 
      thermocellum to the cell wall. In addition, a Cel8A-dockerin fusion protein was 
      anchored on the surface of B. subtilis via noncovalent interactions with a cell 
      wall-attached cohesin module. We also demonstrate that it is possible to assemble 
      multienzyme complexes on the cell surface. A three-enzyme-containing minicellulosome 
      was displayed on the cell surface; it consisted of a cell wall-attached scaffoldin 
      protein noncovalently bound to three cellulase-dockerin fusion proteins that were 
      produced in Escherichia coli. B. subtilis has a robust genetic system and is 
      currently used in a wide range of industrial processes. Thus, grafting larger, more 
      elaborate minicellulosomes onto the surface of B. subtilis may yield cellulolytic 
      bacteria with increased potency that can be used to degrade biomass.

PG  - 2785-9
LID - 10.1002/bit.24933 [doi]
AB  - Cell-surface display of functional proteins is a powerful and useful tool for 
      regulating and reinforcing cellular functions. Direct incorporation of 
      site-specifically lipidated proteins from the extracellular medium is more rapid, 
      easily controllable and reliable in displaying active proteins than expression 
      through gene transfer. However, undesirable amphiphilic reagents such as organic 
      co-solvents and detergents were required for suppressing aggregation of ordinary 
      lipidated proteins in solution. We report here sortase A-catalyzed modification of 
      proteins with a poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)-lipid in situ on the surface of living 
      cells. Proteins fused with a recognition tag were site-specifically ligated with the 
      PEG-lipid which was preliminary incorporated into cell membranes. Accordingly, 
      target proteins were successfully displayed on living cells without aggregation 
      under an amphiphilic reagent-free condition. Furthermore, to demonstrate the 
      availability of the present method, Fc domains of immunoglobulin G were displayed on 
      cancer cells, and the phagocytosis of cancer cells with dendritic cells were 
      enhanced through the Fc-Fc receptor interaction. Thus, the present facile 
      chemoenzymatic method for protein display can be utilized for modulating cell-cell 
      interactions in cell and tissue engineering fields.

AB  - Recently, the fabrication of protein bilayer has been required for the development 
      of protein or enzyme complex formation. In the present study, we fabricated a fusion 
      protein bilayer composed of recombinant azurin-cytochrome P450, which was 
      synthesized by a site-specific sortase-mediated ligation method. The Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa azurin was modified by DNA recombinant technique, for enzymatic ligation 
      and immobilization. The Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450 was also modified for 
      enzymatic ligation. The recombinant metalloproteins were conjugated via the sortase 
      A. The conjugation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and UV-vis. Then, the prepared fusion 
      protein was immobilized on Au substrate, by the self-assembly method. The Azu-P450 
      (recombinant azurin-cytochrome P450) fusion protein layer was confirmed by AFM 
      (Atomic Force Microscopy) and SERS (Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy), to confirm 
      the fusion protein bilayer orientation. Moreover, the electrochemical property of 
      Azu-P450 was observed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As a result, the Azu-P450 fusion 
      protein bilayer shows good orientation on the Au substrate. Also, the original redox 
      property of this fusion protein bilayer has been well maintained. The proposed 
      fusion protein bilayer can.

AB  - In cellular systems, compartmentalization plays an important role in the protection 
      and regulation of enzymes. Controlled encapsulation of enzymes in nanocompartments 
      is crucial in understanding biocatalytic processes in the cellular environment. We 
      have recently described an enzymatic method to covalently attach enzymes, equipped 
      with a small recognition peptide, to the interior of viral capsids. Viral capsids 
      are especially interesting in this respect, as they form very well-defined 
      nanoparticles with a uniform size and shape. Here, we describe the relevant 
      experimental procedures to encapsulate a model enzyme into the interior of a viral 
      capsid, purify the resulting viral capsids, and measure the catalytic activity of 
      the encapsulated enzymes.

TI  - The highly autoaggregative and adhesive phenotype of the vaginal Lactobacillus 
      plantarum strain CMPG5300 is sortase dependent.
PG  - 4576-85
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00926-13 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacilli are important for the maintenance of a healthy ecosystem in the human 
      vagina. Various mechanisms are postulated but so far are poorly substantiated by 
      molecular studies, such as mutant analysis. Bacterial autoaggregation is an 
      interesting phenomenon that can promote adhesion to host cells and displacement of 
      pathogens. In this study, we report on the identification of a human vaginal 
      isolate, Lactobacillus plantarum strain CMPG5300, which shows high autoaggregative 
      and adhesive capacity. To investigate the importance of sortase-dependent proteins 
      (SDPs) in these phenotypes, a gene deletion mutant was constructed for srtA, the 
      gene encoding the housekeeping sortase that covalently anchors these SDPs to the 
      cell surface. This mutant lost the capacity to autoaggregate, showed a decrease in 
      adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells, and lost biofilm-forming capacity under the 
      conditions tested. These results indicate that the housekeeping sortase SrtA of 
      CMPG5300 is a key determinant of the peculiar surface properties of this vaginal 
      Lactobacillus strain.

TI  - Differential roles of sortase-anchored surface proteins and wall teichoic acid in 
      Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization.
PG  - 505-13
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmm.2007.11.006 [doi]
AB  - Most of the severe bacterial infections originate from the endogenous microflora of 
      human body surfaces. However, the molecular basis of colonization, e.g. of the human 
      nose by Staphylococcus aureus, has remained incompletely understood. Several 
      surface-exposed proteins and wall teichoic acid (WTA) polymers have previously been 
      implicated in S. aureus attachment to nasal epithelial cells. Here we dissect the 
      role of these molecules in colonization using S. aureus sortase A (srtA) and tagO 
      mutants deficient in surface protein and WTA display, respectively. Although the two 
      mutants were similarly affected in attachment to nasal cells they were abrogated in 
      binding to different types of epithelial ligands. Surface protein sorting, but not 
      WTA, were required for keratin- or fibronectin-mediated interactions while only 
      WTA-mediated binding to nasal cells was effectively inhibited by polyinosinic acid, 
      indicating a possible role of scavenger receptor-like molecules in WTA-dependent 
      epithelial interactions. Both mutants exhibited profound colonization defects in a 
      cotton rat nasal colonization model, albeit at different stages of colonization 
      (>90% reduced bacterial counts at 24h or several days after inoculation with the 
      tagO or srtA mutant, respectively). These data indicate that S. aureus nasal 
      colonization is a multifactorial process with various ligands affecting initial 
      colonization and prolonged persistence in different ways. Our studies should be 
      useful in the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase, an enzyme that anchors surface proteins to the cell 
      wall.
PG  - 760-3
AB  - Surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria are linked to the bacterial cell wall by 
      a mechanism that involves cleavage of a conserved Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG) motif 
      and that occurs during assembly of the peptidoglycan cell wall. A Staphylococcus 
      aureus mutant defective in the anchoring of surface proteins was isolated and shown 
      to carry a mutation in the srtA gene. Overexpression of srtA increased the rate of 
      surface protein anchoring, and homologs of srtA were found in other pathogenic 
      Gram-positive bacteria. The protein specified by srtA, sortase, may be a useful 
      target for the development of new antimicrobial drugs.

TI  - Anchor structure of staphylococcal surface proteins. V. Anchor structure of the 
      sortase B substrate IsdC.
PG  - 16263-71
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase A cleaves surface protein precursors bearing 
      C-terminal LPXTG motif sorting signals between the threonine and glycine residues. 
      Using lipid II precursor as cosubstrate, sortase A catalyzes the amide linkage 
      between the carboxyl group of threonine and the amino group of pentaglycine 
      cross-bridges, thereby tethering C-terminal ends of surface proteins to the 
      bacterial cell wall envelope. Staphylococcal sortase B also anchors its only known 
      substrate, the IsdC precursor with a C-terminal NPQTN motif sorting signal, to the 
      cell wall envelope. Herein, we determined the cell wall anchor structure of IsdC. 
      The sorting signal of IsdC is cleaved between threonine and asparagine of the NPQTN 
      motif, and the carboxyl group of threonine is amide-linked to the amino group of 
      pentaglycine crossbridges. In contrast to sortase A substrates, the anchor structure 
      of IsdC displays shorter glycan strands and significantly less cell wall 
      cross-linking. A model is proposed whereby sortases A and B recognize unique 
      features of sorting signals and peptidoglycan substrates to deposit proteins with 
      distinct topologies in the cell wall envelope.

AB  - Reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key regulators of protein 
      function and modulate a multitude of protein-protein interactions in signal 
      transduction networks. Here, we describe a strategy for determining the modification 
      preferences of PTM-binding proteins with only minimal protein amounts that can be 
      obtained by immunoprecipitation from mammalian cell lysates. This method bases on 
      the combination of sortase-mediated ligation and phage-assisted selection 
      strategies. This method can be used to analyze the type of modification that 
      mediates the interaction as well as the influence of the amino acids flanking the 
      modification sites. We have demonstrated the applicability of this method by probing 
      the interaction of phosphorylated tyrosine and serine residues with their respective 
      binding domains.

TI  - Double-Network Hydrogels Including Enzymatically Crosslinked 
      Poly-(2-alkyl-2-oxazoline)s for 3D Bioprinting of Cartilage-Engineering Constructs.
PG  - 4502-4511
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.9b01266 [doi]
AB  - Double-network (DN) hydrogels are fabricated from poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) 
      (PEOXA)-peptide conjugates, which can be enzymatically crosslinked in the presence 
      of Sortase A (SA), and physical networks of alginate (Alg), yielding matrices with 
      improved mechanical properties with respect to the corresponding PEOXA and Alg 
      single networks and excellent cell viability of encapsulated human auricular 
      chondrocytes (hACs). The addition of a low content of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) 
      within DN hydrogel formulations provides the rheological properties needed for 
      extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) printing, generating constructs with a good 
      shape fidelity. In the presence of hACs, PEOXA-Alg-CNF prehydrogel mixtures can be 
      bioprinted, finally generating 3D-structured DN hydrogel supports showing a cell 
      viability of more than 90%. Expanding the application of 
      poly(2-alkyl-2-oxazoline)-based formulations in the design of tissue-engineering 
      constructs, this study further demonstrates how SA-mediated enzymatic crosslinking 
      represents a suitable and fully orthogonal method to generate biocompatible 
      hydrogels with fast kinetics.

AB  - Sortase-mediated hydrazinolysis of proteins with hydrazine or its derivatives was

      recombinant protein hydrazides as thioester surrogates. It also provides an 
      alternative method for C-terminal modification of proteins with functional units as 
      well as for the preparation of C-to-C fusion proteins.

LID - 10.1021/bc100206z [doi]
AB  - A ZZ domain (ZZ) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), luciferase (Luc), or glucose oxidase 
      (GOD) were conjugated using Sortase A (SrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus. The 
      specific peptidyl linker for SrtA was genetically fused to the C-terminus of ZZ, and 
      the other linker was fused to the N-terminus of AP, Luc, or GOD, respectively. The 
      resultant proteins were obtained separately by bacterial expression. The recombinant 
      peptide-tagged ZZ and AP, Luc, or GOD were site-specifically conjugated by SrtA 
      through the extra peptidyl linkers in vitro. The SrtA reaction had little influence 
      on either the antibody-binding activity of the ZZ moiety or the enzymatic activity 
      of AP, Luc, or GOD moieties of the conjugates. Additionally, antibody-ZZ-proteins 
      were yielded easily by mixing antibody with ZZ-AP, ZZ-Luc, or ZZ-GOD, allowing their 
      use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results suggest that the 
      enzymatic approach with SrtA facilitates the construction of ZZ-proteins. 
      Furthermore, mixing antibody and ZZ-proteins produces a wide variety of 
      antibody-ZZ-proteins.

TI  - Sortases, Surface Proteins, and Their Roles in Staphylococcus aureus Disease and 
      Vaccine Development.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.PSIB-0004-2018 [doi]
AB  - Sortases cleave short peptide motif sequences at the C-terminal end of secreted 
      surface protein precursors and either attach these polypeptides to the peptidoglycan 
      of Gram-positive bacteria or promote their assembly into pilus structures that are 
      also attached to peptidoglycan. Sortase A, the enzyme first identified in the human 
      pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, binds LPXTG motif sorting signals, cleaves between 
      threonine (T) and glycine (G) residues, and forms an acyl enzyme between its 
      active-site cysteine thiol and the carboxyl group of threonine (T). Sortase A acyl 
      enzyme is relieved by the nucleophilic attack of the cross bridge amino group within 
      lipid II, thereby generating surface protein linked to peptidoglycan precursor. Such 
      products are subsequently incorporated into the cell wall envelope by enzymes of the 
      peptidoglycan synthesis pathway. Surface proteins linked to peptidoglycan may be 
      released from the bacterial envelope to diffuse into host tissues and fulfill 
      specific biological functions. S. aureus sortase A is essential for host 
      colonization and for the pathogenesis of invasive diseases. Staphylococcal 
      sortase-anchored surface proteins fulfill key functions during the infectious 
      process, and vaccine-induced antibodies targeting surface proteins may provide 
      protection against S. aureus. Alternatively, small-molecule inhibitors of sortase 
      may be useful agents for the prevention of S. aureus colonization and invasive 
      disease.

      strains, the participation of drug-tolerant biofilms in pathological changes, and 
      thus the limited number of effective antibiotics, there is an urgent need to search 
      for alternative methods of prevention or treatment for S. aureus infections. In the 
      present study, biochemically characterized (HPLC/UPLC-QTOF-MS) acetonic, ethanolic, 
      and water extracts from fruits and bark of Viburnum opulus L. were tested in vitro 
      as diet additives that potentially prevent staphylococcal infections. The impacts of 
      V. opulus extracts on sortase A (SrtA) activity (Fluorimetric Assay), staphylococcal 
      protein A (SpA) expression (FITC-labelled specific antibodies), the lipid 
      composition of bacterial cell membranes (LC-MS/MS, GC/MS), and biofilm formation 
      (LIVE/DEAD BacLight) were assessed. The cytotoxicity of V. opulus extracts to the 
      human fibroblast line HFF-1 was also tested (MTT reduction). V. opulus extracts 
      strongly inhibited SrtA activity and SpA expression, caused modifications of S. 
      aureus cell membrane, limited biofilm formation by staphylococci, and were 
      non-cytotoxic. Therefore, they have pro-health potential. Nevertheless, their 
      usefulness as diet supplements that are beneficial for the prevention of 
      staphylococcal infections should be confirmed in animal models in the future.

AB  - Enzyme catalysis relies on conformational plasticity, but structural information on 
      transient intermediates is difficult to obtain. We show that the three-dimensional 
      (3D) structure of an unstable, low-abundance enzymatic intermediate can be 
      determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The approach is 
      demonstrated for Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA), which is an established 
      drug target and biotechnological reagent. SrtA is a transpeptidase that converts an 
      amide bond of a substrate peptide into a thioester. By measuring pseudocontact 
      shifts (PCSs) generated by a site-specific cysteine-reactive paramagnetic tag that 
      does not react with the active-site residue Cys184, a sufficient number of 
      restraints were collected to determine the 3D structure of the unstable thioester 
      intermediate of SrtA that is present only as a minor species under non-equilibrium 
      conditions. The 3D structure reveals structural changes that protect the thioester 
      intermediate against hydrolysis.

AB  - Methods to parse paracrine epithelial-stromal communication networks are a vital 
      need in drug development, as disruption of these networks underlies diseases ranging 
      from cancer to endometriosis. Here, we describe a modular, synthetic, and 
      dissolvable extracellular matrix (MSD-ECM) hydrogel that fosters functional 3D 
      epithelial-stromal co-culture, and that can be dissolved on-demand to recover cells 
      and paracrine signaling proteins intact for subsequent analysis. Specifically, 
      synthetic polymer hydrogels, modified with cell-interacting adhesion motifs and 
      crosslinked with peptides that include a substrate for cell-mediated proteolytic 
      remodeling, can be rapidly dissolved by an engineered version of the microbial 
      transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA) if the crosslinking peptide includes a SrtA 
      substrate motif and a soluble second substrate. SrtA-mediated dissolution affected 
      only 1 of 31 cytokines and growth factors assayed, whereas standard protease 
      degradation methods destroyed about half of these same molecules. Using 
      co-encapsulated endometrial epithelial and stromal cells as one model system, we 
      show that the dynamic cytokine and growth factor response of co-cultures to an 
      inflammatory cue is richer and more nuanced when measured from SrtA-dissolved gel 
      microenvironments than from the culture supernate. This system employs accessible, 
      reproducible reagents and facile protocols; hence, has potential as a tool in 
      identifying and validating therapeutic targets in complex diseases.

TI  - Cell wall anchor structure of BcpA pili in Bacillus anthracis.
PG  - 36676-86
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M806796200 [doi]
AB  - Assembly of pili in Gram-positive bacteria and their attachment to the cell wall 
      envelope are mediated by sortases. In Bacillus cereus and its close relative 
      Bacillus anthracis, the major pilin protein BcpA is cleaved between the threonine 
      and the glycine of its C-terminal LPXTG motif sorting signal by the pilin-specific 
      sortase D. The resulting acyl enzyme intermediate is relieved by the nucleophilic 
      attack of the side-chain amino group of lysine within the YPKN motif of another BcpA 
      subunit. Cell wall anchoring of assembled BcpA pili requires sortase A, which also 
      cleaves the LPXTG sorting signal of BcpA between its threonine and glycine residues. 
      We show here that sortases A and D require only the C-terminal sorting signal of 
      BcpA for substrate cleavage. Unlike sortase D, which accepts the YPKN motif as a 
      nucleophile, sortase A forms an amide bond between the BcpA C-terminal carboxyl 
      group of threonine and the side-chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid within the 
      cell wall peptidoglycan of bacilli. These results represent the first demonstration 
      of a cell wall anchor structure for pili, which are deposited by sortase A into the 
      envelope of many different microbes.

TI  - Identification of the Bacillus anthracis (gamma) phage receptor.
PG  - 6742-9
AB  - Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium, is the etiological 
      agent of anthrax. It belongs to the Bacillus cereus group, which also contains 
      Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis. Most B. anthracis strains are sensitive 
      to phage gamma, but most B. cereus and B. thuringiensis strains are resistant to the 
      lytic action of phage gamma. Here, we report the identification of a protein 
      involved in the bacterial receptor for the gamma phage, which we term GamR (Gamma 
      phage receptor). It is an LPXTG protein (BA3367, BAS3121) and is anchored by the 
      sortase A. A B. anthracis sortase A mutant is not as sensitive as the parental 
      strain nor as the sortase B and sortase C mutants, whereas the GamR mutant is 
      resistant to the lytic action of the phage. Electron microscopy reveals the binding 
      of the phage to the surface of the parental strain and its absence from the GamR 
      mutant. Spontaneous B. anthracis mutants resistant to the phage harbor mutations in 
      the gene encoding the GamR protein. A B. cereus strain that is sensitive to the 
      phage possesses a protein similar (89% identity) to GamR. B. thuringiensis 97-27, a 
      strain which, by sequence analysis, is predicted to harbor a GamR-like protein, is 
      resistant to the phage but nevertheless displays phage binding.

TI  - An in vitro compartmentalization-based method for the selection of bond-forming 
      enzymes from large libraries.
PG  - 1647-57
LID - 10.1002/bit.25939 [doi]
AB  - We have developed a generalized in vitro compartmentalization-based bead display 
      selection strategy that allows for the identification of enzymes that can perform 
      ligation reactions. Although a number of methods have been developed to evolve such 
      enzymes, many of them are limited in library size (10(6) -10(7) ), do not select for 
      enzymes using a scheme that allows for multiple turnover, or only work on enzymes 
      specific to nucleic acids. This approach is amenable to screening libraries of up to 
      10(12) protein variants by allowing beads to be overloaded with up to 10(4) unique 
      mutants. Using this approach we isolated a variant of sortase A from Staphylococcus 
      aureus that shows a 114-fold enhancement in kcat /KM in the absence of calcium 
      compared to the wild-type and improved resistance to the inhibitory effects of cell 
      lysates. Unlike the wild-type protein, the newly selected variant shows 
      intracellular activity in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells where it may prove 
      useful for intracellular labeling or synthetic biological applications. Biotechnol.

TI  - On the role of Staphylococcus aureus sortase and sortase-catalyzed surface protein 
      anchoring in murine septic arthritis.
PG  - 1417-24
AB  - Anchoring of Staphylococcus aureus surface protein to the cell wall is catalyzed by 
      sortase, a transpeptidase. The contribution of staphylococcal surface proteins to 
      establishment of infection was examined using a murine septic arthritis model. 
      Intravenous inoculation of mice with the sortase-deficient mutant S. aureus strain 
      SMK3 did not result in weight loss or severe septic arthritis, in contrast to the 
      parent strain, S. aureus Newman. Direct inoculation of the sortase mutant into joint 
      cavities also failed to cause severe synovitis or erosive arthritis. Furthermore, 
      intravenous inoculation with staphylococci resulted in the rapid clearing of the 
      sortase mutant from the bloodstream. This phenomenon demonstrates the involvement of 
      host neutrophils; when these cells were depleted, sortase mutant staphylococci 
      caused severe systemic infection, although not septic arthritis. These results 
      suggest that sortase mutant staphylococci are significantly less virulent than the 
      parent strain, Newman: the sortase mutant has decreased ability to reach target 
      organs and, once there, to induce an inflammatory response.

TI  - Roles of Streptococcus mutans dextranase anchored to the cell wall by sortase.
PG  - 102-5
AB  - In order to clarify the role that sortase (SrtA) plays in anchoring dextranase (Dex) 
      to the cell wall of Streptococcus mutans, both Dex- and SrtA- mutants were 
      constructed by insertional inactivation of the respective genes. Western blot 
      analysis with a Dex antiserum showed that in the srtA mutant the Dex was not bound 
      to the cell wall but was secreted into the culture supernatant. In contrast, in the 
      wild type, Dex remained cell-wall-associated. Biological properties of the srtA 
      mutant were examined in dextran fermentation, colony morphology and adherence to a 
      smooth surface. The srtA mutant, as well as the wild type, retained the ability to 
      ferment dextran. However, the colony morphology of the srtA mutant on Todd Hewitt 
      agar containing sucrose was much larger than that of the wild type and showed a 
      ring-like structure. In addition, the srtA mutant was more adhesive to a smooth 
      surface than the wild type when sucrose was present. However, the adhesion of the 
      srtA mutant remarkably decreased by addition of exogenous dextranase. These studies 
      suggest that the SrtA mediates Dex-anchoring to the cell wall in S. mutans, and cell 
      wall-anchored Dex plays a role in controlling both the adhesive properties of 
      extracellular glucan and the ability to utilize extracellular glucan as a nutrient 
      source. In contrast, extracellular Dex is only responsible for degrading 
      extracellular glucan as a nutrient source.

TI  - Inhibition of the bacterial surface protein anchoring transpeptidase sortase by 
      medicinal plants.
PG  - 2751-4
AB  - Inhibition by medicinal plant extracts of a recombinant sortase was evaluated for 
      antibacterial drug discovery. The coding region of sortase, a transpeptidase that 
      cleaves surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria, was amplified by PCR from the 
      chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538p with the exception of an N-terminal 
      membrane anchor sequence, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by metal 
      chelate affinity chromatography. The purified sortase had maximum activity at pH 7.5 
      and was stable at 20-45 degrees C for the cleavage of a synthetic fluorophore 
      substrate. The enzyme inhibitory activity in medicinal plants was also evaluated for 
      antibacterial drug discovery. Among 80 medicinal plants tested, Cocculus trilobus, 
      Fritillaria verticillata, Liriope platyphylla, and Rhus verniciflua had strong 
      inhibitory activity. The extract with the greatest activity was the ethyl acetate 
      fraction derived from the rhizome of Cocculus trilobus (IC50 = 1.52 microg/ml).

      mechanism in Bacillus anthracis: a combined experimental and theoretical study.
PG  - 221-32
LID - 10.3109/10799893.2013.876044 [doi]
AB  - Members of the sortase enzyme super family decorate the surfaces of Bacillus 
      anthracis cell wall with proteins that play key roles in microbial pathogenesis and 
      its biofilm formation. Bacillus anthracis Sortase-A (Ba-SrtA) is a potential target 
      for new therapeutics as it is required for B. anthracis survival and replication 
      within macrophages. An understanding of the binding site pocket and substrate 
      recognition mechanism by SrtA enzymes may serve to be beneficial in the rational 
      development of sortase inhibitors. Here, the LPXTG signal peptide-based competitive 
      inhibitors are screened against the Ba-SrtA and compounds with reasonable 
      inhibition, specificity, and mechanisms of inactivation of SrtA have been covered. 
      The screened compounds are experimentally validated against the phylogenetically 
      similar Gram-positive pathogen B. cereus. In situ microscopic visualizations suggest 
      that these screened compounds showed the microbial and biofilm inhibitory activity 
      against B. cereus. It facilitates the further development of these molecules into 
      useful anti-infective agents to treat infections caused by B. anthracis and other 
      Gram-positive pathogens. These results provide insight into basic design principles 
      for generating new clinically relevant lead molecules. It also provides an 
      alternative strategy where a screened ligand molecule can be used in combination to 
      battle increasingly against the Gram-positive pathogens.

TI  - Identification of substrates of the Listeria monocytogenes sortases A and B by a 
      non-gel proteomic analysis.
PG  - 4808-17
AB  - Sortases are enzymes that anchor surface proteins to the cell wall of Gram-positive 
      bacteria by cleaving a sorting motif located in the C-terminus of the protein 
      substrate. The best-characterized motif is LPXTG, which is cleaved between the T and 
      G residues. In this study, a non-gel proteomic approach was used to identify surface 
      proteins recognized by the two sortases of Listeria monocytogenes, SrtA and SrtB. 
      Material containing peptidoglycan and strongly associated proteins was purified from 
      sortase-defective mutants, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptide mixture 
      analysed by two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography coupled to ion-trap mass 
      spectrometry. Unlike enzymes involved in peptidoglycan metabolism, other surface 
      proteins displayed uneven distribution in the mutants. A total of 13 
      LPXTG-containing proteins were identified exclusively in strains having a functional 
      SrtA. In contrast, two surface proteins, Lmo2185 and Lmo2186, were identified only 
      when SrtB was active. The analysis of the peptides identified in these proteins 
      suggests that SrtB of L. monocytogenes may recognize two different sorting motifs, 
      NXZTN and NPKXZ. Taken together, these data demonstrate that non-gel proteomics is a 
      powerful technique to rapidly identify sortase substrates and to gain insights on 
      potential sorting motifs.

PG  - 66-73
LID - 10.4248/IJOS11022 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial biofilms can be viewed as a specific type of persistent bacterial 
      infection. After initial invasion, microbes can attach to living and non-living 
      surfaces, such as prosthetics and indwelling medical devices, and form a biofilm 
      composed of extracellular polysaccharides, proteins, and other components. In hosts, 
      biofilm formation may trigger drug resistance and inflammation, resulting in 
      persistent infections. The clinical aspects of biofilm formation and leading 
      strategies for biofilm inhibitors will be discussed in this mini-review.

AB  - New compounds able to counteract staphylococcal biofilm formation are needed. In 
      this study we investigate the mechanism of action of pyrrolomycins, whose potential 
      as antimicrobial agents has been demonstrated. We performed a new efficient and easy 
      method to use microwave organic synthesis suitable for obtaining pyrrolomycins in 
      good yields and in suitable amount for their in vitro in-depth investigation. We 
      evaluate the inhibitory activity towards Sortase A (SrtA), a transpeptidase 
      responsible for covalent anchoring in Gram-positive peptidoglycan of many surface 
      proteins involved in adhesion and in biofilm formation. All compounds show a good 
      inhibitory activity toward SrtA, having IC(50) values ranging from 130 to 300 µM 
      comparable to berberine hydrochloride. Of note compound 1d shows a good affinity in 
      docking experiment to SrtA and exhibits the highest capability to interfere with 
      biofilm formation of S. aureus showing an IC(50) of 3.4 nM. This compound is also 
      effective in altering S. aureus murein hydrolase activity that is known to be 
      responsible for degradation, turnover, and maturation of bacterial peptidoglycan and 
      involved in the initial stages of S. aureus biofilm formation.

TI  - Development of an influenza virus protein array using Sortagging technology.
PG  - 1119-26
LID - 10.1021/bc200577u [doi]
AB  - Protein array technology is an emerging tool that enables high-throughput screening 
      of protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions and identification of 
      immunodominant antigens during the course of a bacterial or viral infection. In this 
      work, we developed an Influenza virus protein array using the sortase-mediated 
      transpeptidation reaction known as "Sortagging". LPETG-tagged Influenza virus 
      proteins from bacterial and eukaryotic cellular extracts were immobilized at their 
      carboxyl-termini onto a preactivated amine-glass slide coated with a Gly3 linker. 
      Immobilized proteins were revealed by specific antibodies, and the newly generated 
      Sortag-protein chip can be used as a device for antigen and/or antibody screening. 
      The specificity of the Sortase A (SrtA) reaction avoids purification steps in array 
      building and allows immobilization of proteins in an oriented fashion. Previously, 
      this versatile technology has been successfully employed for protein labeling and 
      protein conjugation. Here, the tool is implemented to covalently link proteins of a 
      viral genome onto a solid support. The system could readily be scaled up to proteins 
      of larger genomes in order to develop protein arrays for high-throughput screening.

AB  - Standard genetic approaches allow the production of protein composites by fusion of 
      polypeptides in head-to-tail fashion. Some applications would benefit from 
      constructions that are genetically impossible, such as the site-specific linkage of 
      proteins via their N or C termini, when a remaining free terminus is required for 
      biological activity. We developed a method for the production of N-to-N and C-to-C 
      dimers, with full retention of the biological activity of both fusion partners and 
      without inflicting chemical damage on the proteins to be joined. We use sortase A to 
      install on the N or C terminus of proteins of interest the requisite modifications 
      to execute a strain-promoted copper-free cycloaddition and show that the ensuing 
      ligation proceeds efficiently. Applied here to protein-protein fusions, the method 
      reported can be extended to connecting proteins with any entity of interest.

TI  - Functional neoglycopeptides: synthesis and characterization of a new class of MUC1 
      glycoprotein models having core 2-based O-glycan and complex-type N-glycan chains.
PG  - 11117-33
LID - 10.1021/bi901557a [doi]
AB  - An efficient protocol for the construction of MUC1-related glycopeptide analogues 
      having complex O-glycan and N-glycan chains was established by integrating chemical 
      and enzymatic approaches on the functional polymer platforms. We demonstrated the 
      feasibility of sortase A-mediated ligation between two glycopeptide segments by 
      tagging with signal peptides, LPKTGLR and GG, at each C- or N-terminal position. 
      Structural analysis of the macromolecular N,O-glycopeptides was performed by means 
      of ESI-TOFMS (MS/MS) equipped with an electron-captured dissociation device. 
      Immunological assay using MUC1 glycopeptides synthesized in this study revealed that 
      N-glycosylation near the antigenic O-glycosylated PDTR motif did not disturb the 
      interaction between the anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody and this crucial 
      O-glycopeptide moiety. NMR study indicated that the N-terminal immunodominant region 
      [Ala-Pro-Asp-Thr(O-glycan)-Arg] forms an inverse gamma-turn-like structure, while 
      the C-terminal region composed of N-glycopeptide and linker SrtA-peptide was proved 
      to be an independently random structure. These results indicate that the bulky O- 
      and N-glycan chains can function independently as disease-relevant epitopes and 
      ligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins, when both are combined by an artificial 
      intervening peptide having a possible effect of separating N- and C-terminal 
      regions. The present strategy will greatly facilitate rapid synthesis of multiply 
      functionalized complex neoglycopeptides as new types of convenient tools or models 
      for the investigation of thhe structure-function relationship of various 
      glycoproteins and development of novel class glycopeptide-based biopharmaceuticals, 
      drug delivery systems, and biomedical materials.

TI  - Involvement of sortase anchoring of cell wall proteins in biofilm formation by 
      Streptococcus mutans.
PG  - 3773-7
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is one of the best-known biofilm-forming organisms associated 
      with humans. We investigated the role of the sortase gene (srtA) in monospecies 
      biofilm formation and observed that inactivation of srtA caused a decrease in 
      biofilm formation. Genes encoding three putative sortase-dependent proteins were 
      also found to be up-regulated in biofilms versus planktonic cells and mutations in 
      these genes resulted in reduced biofilm biomass.

TI  - Rapid and Direct VHH and Target Identification by Staphylococcal Surface Display 
      Libraries.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18071507 [doi]
LID - 1507
AB  - Unbiased and simultaneous identification of a specific antibody and its target 
      antigen has been difficult without prior knowledge of at least one interaction 
      partner. Immunization with complex mixtures of antigens such as whole organisms and 
      tissue extracts including tumoral ones evokes a highly diverse immune response. 
      During such a response, antibodies are generated against a variety of epitopes in 
      the mixture. Here, we propose a surface display design that is suited to 
      simultaneously identify camelid single domain antibodies and their targets. Immune 
      libraries of single-domain antigen recognition fragments from camelid heavy 
      chain-only antibodies (VHH) were attached to the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive 
      Staphylococcus aureus employing its endogenous housekeeping sortase enzyme. The 
      sortase transpeptidation reaction covalently attached the VHH to the bacterial 
      peptidoglycan. The reversible nature of the reaction allowed the recovery of the VHH 
      from the bacterial surface and the use of the VHH in downstream applications. These 
      staphylococcal surface display libraries were used to rapidly identify VHH as well 
      as their targets by immunoprecipitation (IP). Our novel bacterial surface display 
      platform was stable under harsh screening conditions, allowed fast target 
      identification, and readily permitted the recovery of the displayed VHH for 
      downstream analysis.

TI  - Further evidence that a cell wall precursor [C(55)-MurNAc-(peptide)-GlcNAc] serves 
      as an acceptor in a sorting reaction.
PG  - 2141-7
AB  - Previous studies suggested that a Gly-containing branch of cell wall precursor 
      [C(55)-MurNAc-(peptide)-GlcNAc], which is often referred to as lipid II, might serve 
      as a nucleophilic acceptor in sortase-catalyzed anchoring of surface proteins in 
      Staphylococcus aureus. To test this hypothesis, we first simplified the procedure 
      for in vitro biosynthesis of Gly-containing lipid II by using branched 
      UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide isolated from the cytoplasm of Streptomyces spp. Second, we 
      designed a thin-layer chromatography-based assay in which the mobility of branched 
      but not linear lipid II is shifted in the presence of both sortase and 
      LPSTG-containing peptide. These results and those of additional experiments 
      presented in this study further suggest that lipid II indeed serves as a natural 
      substrate in a sorting reaction.

      adhesion are found on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria: those anchored via an 
      LPXTG motif by the enzyme sortase A (SrtA) and those associated with the cell 
      surface by, as yet, unknown mechanisms. In srtA(-) mutants, LPXTG-containing 
      proteins have been shown to be released rather than cross-linked to the cell wall. 
      We have therefore used 2D gel electrophoresis of released proteins from an srtA(-) 
      mutant as well as the wild-type strain, followed by peptide identification by MS, to 
      identify a set of novel proteins predicted to be present on the surface of S. 
      gordonii DL1. This includes two large LPXTG-linked proteins (SGO_0707 and SGO_1487), 
      which both contain tandemly repeated sequences similar to those present in known 
      fibrillar adhesins. A 5'-nucleotidase and a protein with a putative collagen-binding 
      domain, both containing LPXTG motifs, were also identified. Anchorless proteins with 
      known chaperone, stress response and elongation factor functions, apparently 
      responsible for bacterial binding to keratinocytes and saliva-coated surfaces in the 
      absence of the LPXTG-linked adhesins, were also associated with the cell surface. 
      These data reveal a range of proteins to be present on the S. gordonii DL1 cell 
      surface, the expression of which plays an important role in adhesion to epithelia 
      and which represent likely candidates for novel virulence factors in S. gordonii.

AB  - Six β-carboline alkaloids (1-6) of the eudistomin Y class were isolated from the 
      Korean ascidian Synoicum sp. These compounds were chemically converted to a known 
      compound, eudistomin Y(1) (7) and six new derivatives, designated eudistomins 
      Y(8)-Y(13) (8-13). Several of these natural and synthetic compounds exhibited 
      moderate to significant antimicrobial activity, weak cytotoxic activity, and 
      inhibitory activities toward sortase A, isocitrate lyase, and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. 
      Structure-activity relationships were also deduced.

TI  - Inactivation of srtA gene of Streptococcus mutans inhibits dextran-dependent 
      aggregation by glucan-binding protein C.
PG  - 57-60
AB  - A sortase-deficient mutant of Streptococcus mutans was prepared by insertional 
      inactivation of a sortase gene (srtA). The srtA mutant was defective in cell 
      wall-anchoring of two surface proteins 200 and 75 kDa in size. A previous study has 
      shown that the 200 kDa protein is a surface protein antigen PAc and that the sortase 
      catalyzes cell wall-anchoring of PAc in S. mutans. In this study another surface 
      protein 75 kDa in size was examined by immunologic and physiologic methods. Western 
      blot analysis with a specific antiserum showed that the 75 kDa protein was a surface 
      protein, glucan-binding protein C. The protein was overexpressed under a stress 
      condition including a sublethal concentration of tetracycline. The srtA mutant cells 
      also lost the ability of dextran-dependent aggregation. These results suggest that 
      the S. mutans sortase mediates cell wall-anchoring of the glucan-binding protein C 
      and dextran-dependent aggregation of this organism.

TI  - Ultrafiltration, a useful method for isolation of intermediates in native chemical 
      ligation exemplified with the total synthesis of Sortase AΔN59.
PG  - 257-64
LID - 10.1002/psc.2745 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, ultrafiltration was employed to facilitate the isolation of 
      intermediates in native chemical ligation. Depending on the molecular weight cutoff 
      of the membrane used, molecules with different sizes could be purified, separated, 
      or concentrated by the ultrafiltration process. Total chemical synthesis of the 
      polypeptide chain of the enzyme Sortase AΔN59 was used as an example of the 
      application of ultrafiltration in chemical protein synthesis. Sortase A is a ligase 
      that catalyzes transpeptidation reactions between proteins that have C-terminal 
      LPXTG recognition sequence and Gly5- on the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. 
      Ultrafiltration technique facilitated synthesis of Sortase AΔN59 and was a promising 
      tool in isolation of intermediates in native chemical ligation.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase mutants defective in the display of surface proteins 
      and in the pathogenesis of animal infections.
PG  - 5510-5
AB  - Many gram-positive bacteria covalently tether their surface adhesins to the cell 
      wall peptidoglycan. We find that surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus are 
      linked to the cell wall by sortase, an enzyme that cleaves polypeptides at a 
      conserved LPXTG motif. S. aureus mutants lacking sortase fail to process and display 
      surface proteins and are defective in the establishment of infections. Thus, the 
      cell wall envelope of gram-positive bacteria represents a surface organelle 
      responsible for interactions with the host environment during the pathogenesis of 
      bacterial infections.

TI  - Sortases and pilin elements involved in pilus assembly of Corynebacterium 
      diphtheriae.
PG  - 251-61
AB  - Corynebacterium diphtheriae SpaA pili are composed of three pilin subunits, SpaA, 
      SpaB and SpaC. SpaA, the major pilin protein, is distributed uniformly along the 
      pilus shaft, whereas SpaB is observed at regular intervals, and SpaC seems to be 
      positioned at the pilus tip. Pilus assembly in C. diphtheriae requires the pilin 
      motif and the C-terminal sorting signal of SpaA, and is proposed to occur by a 
      mechanism of ordered cross-linking, whereby pilin-specific sortase enzymes cleave 
      precursor proteins at sorting signals and involve the side-chain amino groups of 
      pilin motif sequences to generate covalent linkages between pilin subunits. We show 
      here that two elements of SpaA pilin precursor, the pilin motif and the sorting 
      signal, are together sufficient to promote the polymerization of an otherwise 
      secreted protein by a process requiring the function of the sortase A gene (srtA). 
      Five other sortase genes are dispensable for SpaA pilus assembly. Further, the 
      incorporation of SpaB into SpaA pili requires a glutamic acid residue within the E 
      box motif of SpaA, a feature that is found to be conserved in other Gram-positive 
      pathogens that encode sortase and pilin subunit genes with sorting signals and pilin 
      motifs. When the main fimbrial subunit of Actinomyces naeslundii type I fimbriae, 
      FimA, is expressed in corynebacteria, C. diphtheriae strain NCTC13129 polymerized 
      FimA to form short fibres. Although C. diphtheriae does not depend on other 
      actinomycetal genes for FimA polymerization, this process involves the pilin motif 
      and the sorting signal of FimA as well as corynebacterial sortase D (SrtD). Thus, 
      pilus assembly in Gram-positive bacteria seems to occur by a universal mechanism of 
      ordered cross-linking of precursor proteins, the multiple conserved features of 
      which are recognized by designated sortase enzymes.

TI  - Cyclic peptides of the nocardamine class from a marine-derived bacterium of the 
      genus Streptomyces.
PG  - 623-5
AB  - Two new cyclic peptides (2 and 3) along with the previously reported nocardamine (1) 
      were isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete of the genus Streptomyces 
      isolated from an unidentified marine sponge. On the basis of the results of combined 
      spectral analyses, the structures of the new compounds were defined to be the 
      dehydroxy and desmethylenyl derivatives of nocardamine, respectively. The new 
      compounds exhibited weak inhibition against the enzyme sortase B.

AB  - Eight new sesterterpenes (2, 5, and 10-15), including structurally related 
      pentaprenyl hydroquinones (2 and 5), and seven known ones of the same structural 
      classes were isolated from the sponge Coscinoderma sp., collected from Chuuk Island, 
      Micronesia. On the basis of the results of combined spectroscopic analyses, the new 
      compounds were determined to be derivatives of the halisulfates and suvanine. These 
      compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against the K562 cell line and inhibitory 
      activities against isocitrate lyase, sortase A, and Na+/K+-ATPase; significant 
      structure-activity relationships were evident.

TI  - Optimization of the Production of Covalently Circularized Nanodiscs and Their 
      Characterization in Physiological Conditions.
PG  - 3525-3532
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b00025 [doi]
AB  - Lipid nanodiscs are widely used platforms for studying membrane proteins in a 
      near-native environment. Lipid nanodiscs made with membrane scaffold proteins (MSPs) 
      in the linear form have been well studied. Recently, a new kind of nanodisc made 
      with MSPs in the circular form, referred to as covalently circularized nanodiscs 
      (cNDs), has been reported to have some possible advantages in various applications. 
      Given the potential of nanodisc technology, researchers in the field are very 
      interested in learning more about this new kind of nanodisc, such as its 
      reproducibility, production yield, and the possible pros and cons of using it. 
      However, research on these issues is lacking. Here, we report a new study on 
      nanodiscs made with circular MSPs, which are produced from a method different from 
      the previously reported method. We show that our novel production method, 
      detergent-assisted sortase-mediated ligation, can effectively avoid 
      high-molecular-weight byproducts and also significantly improve the yield of the 
      target proteins up to around 80% for larger circular MSP constructs. In terms of the 
      application of circular MSPs, we demonstrate that they can be used to assemble 
      nanodiscs using both synthetic lipids and native lipid extract as the source of 
      lipids. We also show that bacteriorhodopsin can be successfully incorporated into 
      this new kind of cND. Moreover, we found that cNDs have improved stability against 
      both heat and high-concentration-induced aggregations, making them more beneficial 
      for related applications.

LID - 10.1038/srep31899 [doi]
LID - 31899
AB  - Sortase mediated ligation is a highly specific platform for conjugation that relies 
      on the specificity of the transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA) for short peptide 
      sequences (LPXTG and GGG). SrtA retains its specificity while accepting a wide range 
      of potential substrates, but its broad use is limited by the wild-type enzyme's poor 
      kinetics, which require large amounts of SrtA and extended reaction times for 
      efficient conjugation. Prior explorations have aimed to improve the kinetics of SrtA 
      with limited success. Herein we describe the discovery of further improved SrtA 
      variants with increased efficiency for the conjugation reaction, and demonstrate 
      their robustness in labelling proteins and antibodies in a site-specific manner. Our 
      variants require significantly lower amounts of enzyme than WT SrtA and can be used 
      to attach small molecules to the N or C-terminus of the heavy or light chain in 
      antibodies with excellent yields. These improved variants can also be used for 
      highly efficient site-specific PEGylation.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of Streptococcus sanguinis cell wall-anchored proteins in 
      early infective endocarditis.
PG  - 4966-75
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00760-09 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is a member of the viridans group of streptococci and a 
      leading cause of the life-threatening endovascular disease infective endocarditis. 
      Initial contact with the cardiac infection site is likely mediated by S. sanguinis 
      surface proteins. In an attempt to identify the proteins required for this crucial 
      step in pathogenesis, we searched for surface-exposed, cell wall-anchored proteins 
      encoded by S. sanguinis and then used a targeted signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) 
      approach to evaluate their contributions to virulence. Thirty-three predicted cell 
      wall-anchored proteins were identified-a number much larger than those found in 
      related species. The requirement of each cell wall-anchored protein for infective 
      endocarditis was assessed in the rabbit model. It was found that no single cell 
      wall-anchored protein was essential for the development of early infective 
      endocarditis. STM screening was also employed for the evaluation of three predicted 
      sortase transpeptidase enzymes, which mediate the cell surface presentation of cell 
      wall-anchored proteins. The sortase A mutant exhibited a modest (approximately 
      2-fold) reduction in competitiveness, while the other two sortase mutants were 
      indistinguishable from the parental strain. The combined results suggest that while 
      cell wall-anchored proteins may play a role in S. sanguinis infective endocarditis, 
      strategies designed to interfere with individual cell wall-anchored proteins or 
      sortases would not be effective for disease prevention.

TI  - Pili with strong attachments: Gram-positive bacteria do it differently.
PG  - 320-30
AB  - Bacteria attach to their appropriate environmental niche by using adhesins. To 
      maximize their contact with the environment, adhesins are often present on the ends 
      of long hairlike structures called pili. Recently, attention has focused on pili of 
      Gram-positive bacteria because they may be vaccine candidates in important human 
      pathogens. These pili differ from the well-studied pili of Gram-negative bacteria 
      because their subunits are covalently linked, they do not require specific 
      chaperones for assembly, and the tip protein (likely to be the adhesin) is not 
      required to initiate formation of the pilus structure. In Gram-positive bacteria, 
      the genes for pili occur in clusters, which may constitute mobile genetic elements. 
      These clusters include the transpeptidase(s) of the sortase family that is/are 
      required for polymerization of the subunit proteins. However, efficient covalent 
      attachment of the completed pilus structure to the cell wall is accomplished, in 
      cases where this has been studied, by the 'housekeeping' sortase, which is 
      responsible for attachment to the peptidoglycan of most surface proteins containing 
      cell wall sorting signals. This enzyme is encoded elsewhere on the genome. Because 
      pili of Gram-positive bacteria have not been extensively investigated yet, we hope 
      that this MicroReview will help to pinpoint the areas most in need of further study.

TI  - Anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus. III. Lipid 
      II is an in vivo peptidoglycan substrate for sortase-catalyzed surface protein 
      anchoring.
PG  - 16241-8
AB  - Surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus are anchored to the cell wall 
      peptidoglycan by a mechanism requiring a C-terminal sorting signal with an LPXTG 
      motif. Surface proteins are first synthesized in the bacterial cytoplasm and then 
      transported across the cytoplasmic membrane. Cleavage of the N-terminal signal 
      peptide of the cytoplasmic surface protein P1 precursor generates the extracellular 
      P2 species, which is the substrate for the cell wall anchoring reaction. Sortase, a 
      membrane-anchored transpeptidase, cleaves P2 between the threonine (T) and the 
      glycine (G) of the LPXTG motif and catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between 
      the carboxyl group of threonine and the amino group of cell wall cross-bridges. We 
      have used metabolic labeling of staphylococcal cultures with [(32)P]phosphoric acid 
      to reveal a P3 intermediate. The (32)P-label of immunoprecipitated surface protein 
      is removed by treatment with lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase that 
      separates the cell wall anchor structure. Furthermore, the appearance of P3 is 
      prevented in the absence of sortase or by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. 
      (32)P-Labeled cell wall anchor species bind to nisin, an antibiotic that is known to 
      form a complex with lipid II. Thus, it appears that the P3 intermediate represents 
      surface protein linked to the lipid II peptidoglycan precursor. The data support a 
      model whereby lipid II-linked polypeptides are incorporated into the growing 
      peptidoglycan via the transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions of cell wall 
      synthesis, generating mature cell wall-linked surface protein.

TI  - Visualization of the pH-dependent dynamic distribution of G2A in living cells.
PG  - 3965-74
LID - 10.1096/fj.14-252999 [doi]
AB  - G2A (from G2 accumulation) receptor is a member of the proton-sensing G-protein 
      coupled receptor (GPCR) family and induces signal transduction events that regulate 
      the cell cycle, proliferation, oncogenesis, and immunity. The mechanism by which 
      G2A-mediated signal transduction is regulated by the extracellular pH remains 
      unresolved. Here, we first visualize the pH-dependent G2A distribution change in 
      living cells by a sortase A-mediated pulse labeling technology: the short-peptide 
      tag-fused human G2A on human embryo kidney HEK293T cell surfaces was labeled with a 
      small fluorescent dye in the presence of lysophosphatidylcholine, and the labeled 
      G2A was chased at acidic and neutral pHs in real time by microscope time course 
      observations. G2A internalization from cell surfaces into intracellular compartments 
      was observed to be inhibited under acidic pH conditions, and this inhibition was 
      relieved at neutral pH. Additionally, the internalized G2A was redistributed onto 
      cell surfaces by jumping from a neutral to an acidic pH. From quantitative image 
      analysis data, we conclude the amount of G2A on the cell surface was controlled by 
      suppressing the G2A internalization rate by one-tenth in response to the 
      extracellular acidic pH, and this acidic pH-induced G2A accumulation on cell 
      surfaces may be explained by proton-induced dissociation of G2A from endocytic 
      machinery.

TI  - Anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus. Sortase 
      catalyzed in vitro transpeptidation reaction using LPXTG peptide and NH(2)-Gly(3) 
      substrates.
PG  - 9876-81
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase anchors surface proteins to the cell wall envelope by 
      cleaving polypeptides at the LPXTG motif. Surface proteins are linked to the 
      peptidoglycan by an amide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl and the amino group 
      of the pentaglycine cross-bridge. We find that purified recombinant sortase 
      hydrolyzed peptides bearing an LPXTG motif at the peptide bond between threonine and 
      glycine. In the presence of NH(2)-Gly(3), sortase catalyzed exclusively a 
      transpeptidation reaction, linking the carboxyl group of threonine to the amino 
      group of NH(2)-Gly(3). In the presence of amino group donors the rate of sortase 
      mediated cleavage at the LPXTG motif was increased. Hydrolysis and transpeptidation 
      required the sulfhydryl of cysteine 184, suggesting that sortase catalyzed the 
      transpeptidation reaction of surface protein anchoring via the formation of a 
      thioester acyl-enzyme intermediate.

      (SrtA) by substrate-derived affinity labels.
PG  - 953-8
AB  - We report on the first synthesis, kinetic evaluation and application of novel 
      substrate-derived inhibitors against the Staphylococcus aureus cysteine 
      protease-transpeptidase, sortase (staphylococcal surface protein sorting A, SrtA). 
      The peptidyl-diazomethane and peptidyl-chloromethane analogues, Cbz 
      (benzyloxycarbonyl)-Leu-Pro-Ala-Thr-CHN(2) (I) and Cbz-Leu-Pro-Ala-Thr-CH(2)Cl (II) 
      respectively were found to act as time-dependent irreversible inhibitors of 
      recombinant sortase (SrtA(DeltaN)). The peptidyl-chloromethane analogue (II) was the 
      most powerful with an inhibitor specificity constant (k(i)/K(i)) of 5.3x10(4) 
      M(-1).min(-1), approx. 2-fold greater than that determined for the 
      peptidyl-diazomethane (I). Additionally, using Western-blot analysis, we have been 
      able to demonstrate that a biotinylated version of the peptidyl-diazomethane 
      analogue, biotin-Ahx (aminohexanoyl)-Leu-Pro-Ala-Thr-CHN(2) (III), can be used as an 
      affinity label to detect the presence of wild-type SrtA in crude cell lysates 
      prepared from S. aureus.

      chemoenzymatic formation of new covalent bonds between two polypeptides, or between 
      a single polypeptide and a new molecule (polymer, small molecule, nucleic acid, 
      carbohydrate, etc.). Due to the modest selectivity of chemical methods for protein 
      conjugation, there are increased efforts to develop biocatalysts that confer 
      regioselectivity for site-specific modification, thereby complementing the existing 
      toolbox of chemical conjugation strategies. This review summarizes key advances in 
      the use of enzymes to functionalize proteins with commercial relevance. The examples 
      put forth have demonstrated value at the industrial level or show promising 
      industrial potential in the laboratory.

TI  - PROLink-Single Step Circularization and Purification Procedure for the Generation of 
      an Improved Variant of Human Growth Hormone.
PG  - 1341-7
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00137 [doi]
AB  - Human growth hormone (hGH) plays an important role during human development and is 
      also an approved therapeutic for the treatment of several diseases. However, one 
      major drawback of hGH is its short circulating half-life requiring frequent 
      administration, which is inconvenient and painful for the patients. Recent 
      publications indicate that circularization greatly increases the stability of 
      proteins due to their protection from exoproteolytic attack and a higher thermal 
      stability of the circular form. Using sortase A, a transpeptidase isolated from 
      Staphylococcus aureus, we developed a single step solid-phase circularization and 
      purification procedure resulting in a circular version of hGH with improved 
      properties. We could show that circular hGH binds to the recombinant hGH receptor 
      with binding kinetics similar to those of linear hGH and that circularization does 
      not alter the biological activity of hGH in vitro. Besides, circular hGH showed 
      almost complete resistance toward exoproteolytic attack and slightly increased 
      thermal stability which could possibly translate into an extended plasma half-life. 
      The single step solid-phase circularization and purification procedure is in 
      principle a generic process, which could also be applied for other proteins that 
      meet the requirements for circularization.

TI  - Mutational analysis of active site residues in the Staphylococcus aureus 
      transpeptidase SrtA.
PG  - 7269-78
AB  - In Staphylococcus aureus, virulence and colonization-associated surface proteins are 
      covalently anchored to the cell wall by the transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA). In 
      order to better understand the contribution of specific active site residues to 
      substrate recognition and catalysis, we performed mutational analysis of several key 
      residues in the SrtA active site. Analysis of protein stability, kinetic parameters, 
      solvent isotope effects, and pH-rate profiles for key SrtA variants are consistent 
      with a reverse protonated Cys184-His120 catalytic dyad, and implicate a role for 
      Arg197 in formation of an oxyanion hole to stabilize the transition state. In 
      contrast, mutation of Asp185 and Asp186 produced negligible effects on catalysis, 
      and no evidence was found to support the existence of a functional catalytic triad. 
      Mutation of Thr180, Leu181, and Ile182 to alanine produced modest decreases in SrtA 
      activity and led to substrate inhibition. Thermodynamic stability measurements by 
      SUPREX (stability of unpurified proteins from rates of H/D exchange) revealed 
      decreases in conformational stability that correlate with the observed substrate 
      inhibition for each variant, signifying a potential role for the conserved 
      180TLITC184 motif in defining the active-site architecture of SrtA. In contrast, 
      mutation of Thr183 to alanine led to a significant 1200-fold decrease in kcat, which 
      appears to be unrelated to conformational stability. Potential explanations for 
      these results are discussed, and a revised model for SrtA catalysis is presented.

AB  - G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in many diseases and important 
      biological phenomena; elucidating the mechanisms underlying regulation of their 
      signal transduction potentially provides both novel targets for drug discovery and 
      insight into living systems. A proton-sensing GPCR, ovarian cancer G protein-coupled 
      receptor 1 (OGR1), has been reported to be related to acidosis and diseases that 
      cause tissue acidification, but the mechanism of proton-induced activation of 
      OGR1-mediated signal transduction in acidic conditions remains unclear. Here, 
      pH-dependent intracellular trafficking of OGR1 was visualized in living leukocytes 
      by a real-time fluorescence microscopic method based on sortase A-mediated pulse 
      labeling of OGR1. OGR1 labeled on the cell surface with a small fluorescent dye was 
      clearly observed to remain in the plasma membrane during incubation in mildly acidic 
      medium (pH 6.6) and to be internalized to the intracellular compartments on changing 
      the medium to slightly basic pH (7.7). Quantitative single-cell image analysis 
      showed that most of the internalized OGR1s were then recycled to the plasma membrane 
      for signal transduction if the extracellular pH was returned to the mildly acidic 
      state. However, in a minor population of cells (40%), the internalized OGR1s were 
      retained in endosomes or transported to lysosomes and degraded, leading to low 
      efficiency of their recycling to the plasma membrane. Thus, the present live-cell 
      monitoring strongly suggests that the signal transduction activity of OGR1 is 
      regulated by pH-dependent internalization and recycling to the plasma membrane.

TI  - Ligand-Induced Cross-Linking of Z-Elastin-like Polypeptide-Functionalized E2 Protein 
      Nanoparticles for Enhanced Affinity Precipitation of Antibodies.
PG  - 1654-1659
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00275 [doi]
AB  - Affinity precipitation is an ideal alternative to chromatography for antibody 
      purification because it combines the high selectivity of an affinity ligand with the 
      operational benefits of precipitation. However, the widespread use of elastin-like 
      polypeptide (ELP) capture scaffolds for antibody purification has been hindered by 
      the high salt concentrations and temperatures necessary for efficient ELP 
      aggregation. In this paper, we employed a tandem approach to enhance ELP aggregation 
      by enlarging the dimension of the capturing scaffold and by creating IgG-triggered 
      scaffold cross-linking. This was accomplished by covalently conjugating the 
      Z-domain-ELP (Z-ELP) capturing scaffold to a 25 nm diameter E2 protein nanocage 
      using Sortase A ligation. We demonstrated the isothermal recovery of IgG in the 
      virtual absence of salt due to the significantly increased scaffold dimension and 
      cross-linking from multivalent IgG-E2 interactions. Because IgG cross-linking is 
      reversible at low pH, it may be feasible to achieve a high yielding IgG purification 
      by isothermal phase separation using a simple pH trigger.

TI  - SpyTag/SpyCatcher Functionalization of E2 Nanocages with Stimuli-Responsive Z-ELP 
      Affinity Domains for Tunable Monoclonal Antibody Binding and Precipitation 
      Properties.
PG  - 3113-3120
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00458 [doi]
AB  - E2 nanocages functionalized with Z-domain-elastin-like polypeptide affinity ligands 
      (Z-ELP(40)) using Sortase A (SrtA) ligation have been shown to be a promising 
      scaffold for purifying monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) based on affinity precipitation. 
      However, the reversible nature of SrtA reaction has been attributed to the low 
      ligation efficiency (<25%) and has significantly limited the practical utility of 
      the technology. Here, we reported an improved conjugation platform using the 
      SpyTag/SpyCatcher pair to form a spontaneous isopeptide bond between SpyTag-E2 and 
      Z-ELP-SpyCatcher fusion proteins of two different ELP chain-lengths. Using this 
      system, E2 ligation efficiencies exceeding 90% were obtained with both 40- and 
      80-repeat Z-ELP-SpyCatcher fusions. This enabled the production of nanocages fully 
      functionalized with Z-ELP for improved aggregation and mAb binding. Compared to the 
      50% decorated Z-ELP(40)-E2 nanocages produced by SrtA ligation, the fully decorated 
      Z-ELP(80)-Spy-E2 nanocages exhibited a 10 °C lower transition temperature and a 
      2-fold higher mAb binding capacity. The improved transition property of the longer 
      Z-ELP(80) backbone allowed for >90% recovery of Z-ELP(80)-Spy-E2 nanocages at room 
      temperature using 0.1 M ammonium sulfate after mAb elution. The flexibility of 
      customizing different affinity domains onto the SpyTag-E2 scaffold should expand our 
      ability to purify other non-mAb target proteins based on affinity precipitation.

AB  - Eleven new meroditerpenoids (7-11, 14-17, 19, 20) and nine known compounds (1-6, 12, 
      13, 18) were isolated from the brown alga Sargassum siliquastrum. Combined chemical 
      and spectroscopic analyses revealed a common tetraprenyl hydroquinone structure; 
      these compounds belonged to the nahocol, isonahocol, and sargahydroquinoic acid 
      classes. The dihydroquinone moiety of 20 was unique and unprecedented in a brown 
      alga. Stereochemical assignments were made for several of the known compounds based 
      on their chemical reactivity. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant 
      radical-scavenging activity as well as weak inhibitory activities against sortase A 
      and isocitrate lyase.

LID - S0168-1605(18)30064-3 [pii]

AB  - Next to applications in fermentations, Lactobacillus plantarum is recognized as a 
      food spoilage organism, and its dispersal from biofilms in food processing 
      environments might be implicated in contamination or recontamination of food 
      products. This study provides new insights into biofilm development by L. plantarum 
      WCFS1 through comparative analysis of wild type and mutants affected in cell surface 
      composition, including mutants deficient in the production of Sortase A involved in 
      the covalent attachment of 27 predicted surface proteins to the cell wall 
      peptidoglycan (ΔsrtA) and mutants deficient in the production of capsular 
      polysaccharides (CPS1-4, Δcps1-4). Surface adhesion and biofilm formation studies 
      revealed none of the imposed cell surface modifications to affect the initial 
      attachment of cells to polystyrene while biofilm formation based on Crystal Violet 
      (CV) staining was severely reduced in the ΔsrtA mutant and significantly increased 
      in mutants lacking the cps1 cluster, compared to the wild-type strain. Fluorescence 
      microscopy analysis of biofilm samples pointed to a higher presence of extracellular 
      DNA (eDNA) in cps1 mutants and this corresponded with increased autolysis activity. 
      Subsequent studies using Δacm2 and ΔlytA derivatives affected in lytic behaviour 
      revealed reduced biofilm formation measured by CV staining, confirming the relevance 
      of lysis for the build-up of the biofilm matrix with eDNA.

AB  - All sorted: The enzyme Sortase A was used to catalyze functionalization of PEGylated 
      capsules with an activation-specific anti-platelet single-chain antibody (scFv). 
      This enzymatic method allows fast, covalent, and site-directed functionalization of 
      delivery vehicles under mild conditions. Activation-specific anti-platelet 
      scFv-coated PEGylated capsules exhibited a high level of selective binding to 
      thrombi, thus suggesting their potential for thrombosis therapy.

AB  - Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is one of the major causes of biofilm 
      infections. Berberine hydrochloride (BBH) has diverse pharmacological effects; 
      however, the effects and mechanisms of BBH on E. faecalis biofilm formation and 
      dispersion have not been reported. In this study, 99 clinical isolates from the 
      urine samples of patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) were collected and 
      identified. Ten strains of E. faecalis with biofilm formation ability were studied. 
      BBH inhibited E. faecalis biofilm formation and promoted the biofilm dispersion of 
      E. faecalis. In addition, sortase A and esp expression levels were elevated during 
      early E. faecalis biofilm development, whereas BBH significantly reduced their 
      expression levels. The results of this study indicated that BBH effectively prevents 
      biofilm formation and promotes biofilm dispersion in E. faecalis, most likely by 
      inhibiting the expressions of sortase A and esp.

AB  - Two new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of the discorhabdin class, along with 12 
      compounds including one previously described synthetic derivative of the same and 
      related skeletal classes, were isolated from the sponge Sceptrella sp., collected 
      from Gageodo, Korea. The structures of these new compounds, designated as 
      (-)-3-dihydrodiscorhabdin D (11) and (-)-discorhabdin Z (12), were determined by 
      combined spectroscopic analyses. Compound 12 possesses an unusual hemiaminal group 
      among the discorhabdin alkaloids. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant 
      cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and inhibitory activity against sortase A.

LID - 10.1021/np500834d [doi]
AB  - Twenty-four metabolites, including seven new compounds (1-7), were isolated from the 
      dried fruits of Psoralea corylifolia. On the basis of combined spectroscopic and 
      chemical analysis, the new compounds were determined to be six flavonoids (1-6) and 
      a meroterpenoid (7). The absolute configurations of the natural products obtained, 
      including the previously undetermined 16 and 17, were assigned by several methods, 
      such as NOE spectroscopy, optical rotation, and CD spectroscopy. Several of these 
      compounds exhibited moderate inhibitory activity toward Staphylococcus 
      mutans-derived SrtA (2, 6, and 16) and significant stimulation of SIRT1 activity (2, 
      3, and 15).

TI  - Disruption of srtA gene in Streptococcus suis results in decreased interactions with 
      endothelial cells and extracellular matrix proteins.
PG  - 417-24
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major pathogen of swine, is an emerging zoonotic agent which 
      causes meningitis and septic shock. In this study, we investigated the ability of S. 
      suis mutant strain (SRTDeltaA) lacking the sortase A gene (srtA) to interact with 
      host cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, as well as its virulence in a 
      mouse infection model. We demonstrated that mutant SRTDeltaA had reduced capacity to 
      adhere to and invade porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells compared to the 
      wild-type strain. In addition, mutant SRTDeltaA also showed significantly less 
      adherence to plasma fibronectin, cellular fibronectin and collagen type I. However, 
      disruption of srtA had little effect on the virulence of S. suis in a mouse 
      intraperitoneal model of infection. These results indicate that surface proteins 
      anchored by sortase A are required for a normal level of bacterial binding. However, 
      other factors may also be important for S. suis virulence and interaction with host 
      tissues.

TI  - Assembly of pili on the surface of Bacillus cereus vegetative cells.
PG  - 495-510
AB  - Vegetative forms of Bacillus cereus are reported to form pili, thin protein 
      filaments that protrude up to 1 mum from the bacterial surface. Pili are assembled 
      from two precursor proteins, BcpA and BcpB, in a manner requiring a pilus-associated 
      sortase enzyme (SrtD). Pili are also formed on the surface of Bacillus anthracis 
      expressing bcpA-srtD-bcpB. BcpA is distributed throughout the entire pilus, whereas 
      BcpB appears positioned at its tip. In agreement with the hypothesis for pilus 
      assembly in Gram-positive bacteria, BcpA encompasses the YPK pilin motif and the 
      LPXTG sorting signal, each of which is absolutely required for the incorporation of 
      BcpA and BcpB into pili. In contrast to BcpB, which relies on the presence of BcpA 
      for incorporation into pili, BcpA fibre assembly occurs even in the absence of BcpB. 
      B. anthracis sortase A (srtA), but not sortase B (srtB) or C (srtC), is required for 
      proper anchoring of pili to the bacterial envelope, suggesting that BcpA/BcpB pili 
      are linked to peptidoglycan cross-bridges.

AB  - The quantification of lipids and assessment of lipid composition is an indispensable 
      step during the pharmaceutical development of novel lipid based drug delivery 
      systems such as liposomes. Broad excipient screenings of such formulations raise the 
      need for versatile analytical methods. Even more demanding complexity is generated 
      by introduction of targeted systems requiring functionalized lipids. We addressed 
      this demand by developing an rp-HPLC based analytical method with evaporative light 
      scattering detection (ELSD) for the simultaneous analysis of commonly used 
      phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol and bilayer surface-modifying cationic, anionic or 
      PEGylated lipids, which can be analyzed in combination with novel pentaglycine 
      lipids suitable as targeting ligand anchor. The method was validated for 
      specificity, precision, accuracy and sample stability. We monitor the continuous and 
      scalable manufacturing of two pentaglycine-modified liposomal formulations and track 
      the modification of these drug delivery systems with a single-domain antibody 
      utilizing bioorthogonal Sortase-A technology. Both the presented analytical and 
      preparative techniques can help to improve the quality control and to accelerate the 
      pharmaceutical development of such targeted drug delivery systems.

TI  - Enterococcal biofilm formation and virulence in an optimized murine model of foreign 
      body-associated urinary tract infections.
PG  - 4166-75
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00711-10 [doi]
AB  - Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) constitute the majority of 
      nosocomial UTIs and pose significant clinical challenges. Enterococcal species are 
      among the predominant causative agents of CAUTIs. However, very little is known 
      about the pathophysiology of Enterococcus-mediated UTIs. We optimized a murine model 
      of foreign body-associated UTI in order to mimic conditions of indwelling catheters 
      in patients. In this model, the presence of a foreign body elicits major 
      histological changes and induces the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines 
      in the bladder. In addition, in contrast to naïve mice, infection of 
      catheter-implanted mice with Enterococcus faecalis induced the specific expression 
      of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) in the 
      bladder. These responses resulted in a favorable niche for the development of 
      persistent E. faecalis infections in the murine bladders and kidneys. Furthermore, 
      biofilm formation on the catheter implant in vivo correlated with persistent 
      infections. However, the enterococcal autolytic factors GelE and Atn (also known as 
      AtlA), which are important in biofilm formation in vitro, are dispensable in vivo. 
      In contrast, the housekeeping sortase A (SrtA) is critical for biofilm formation and 
      virulence in CAUTIs. Overall, this murine model represents a significant advance in 
      the understanding of CAUTIs and underscores the importance of urinary 
      catheterization during E. faecalis uropathogenesis. This model is also a valuable 
      tool for the identification of virulence determinants that can serve as potential 
      antimicrobial targets for the treatment of enterococcal infections.

TI  - Cellular aspects of the distinct M protein and SfbI anchoring pathways in 
      Streptococcus pyogenes.
PG  - 631-47
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2012.08047.x [doi]
AB  - Wall-anchored surface proteins are critical for the in vivo survival of 
      Streptococcus pyogenes. Cues in the signal sequence direct the membrane 
      translocation of surface proteins: M protein to the septum, and SfbI to the poles. 
      Both proteins are subsequently anchored to the wall by the membrane bound enzyme 
      sortase A. However, the cellular features of these pathways are not fully 
      understood. Here we show that M protein and SfbI are anchored simultaneously 
      throughout the cell cycle. M protein is rapidly anchored at the septum, and in part 
      of the cell cycle, is anchored simultaneously at the mother and daughter septa. 
      Conversely, SfbI accumulates gradually on peripheral peptidoglycan, resulting in a 
      polar distribution. Sortase is not required for translocation of M protein or SfbI 
      at their respective locations. Methicillin-induced unbalanced peptidoglycan 
      synthesis diminishes surface M protein but not SfbI. Furthermore, overexpression of 
      the division regulator DivIVA also diminishes surface M protein but increases SfbI. 
      These results demonstrate a close connection between the regulation of cell division 
      and protein anchoring. Better understanding of the spatial regulation of surface 
      anchoring may lead to the identification of novel targets for the development of 
      anti-infective agents, given the importance of surface molecules for pathogenesis.

AB  - Five new dihydroxystyrene metabolites and six known compounds of the same structural 
      class were isolated from an association of the sponges Poecillatra wondoensis and 
      Jaspis sp., collected from Keomun Island, Korea. The structures of novel compounds 
      were determined to be the sodium or N, N-dimethyl guanidinium salts of a 
      dihydroxystyrene dimer (5) and two trimers (6, 7). Two dimers (10, 11) containing 
      imidazole moieties were also identified on the basis of the results of combined 
      spectroscopic analyses. Several compounds exhibited weak to moderate inhibitory 
      effects against isocitrate lyase and sortase A enzymes derived from microorganisms.

TI  - Molecular dissection of the secA2 locus of group B Streptococcus reveals that 
      glycosylation of the Srr1 LPXTG protein is required for full virulence.
PG  - 4195-206
LID - 10.1128/JB.01673-08 [doi]
AB  - In streptococci, the secA2 locus includes genes encoding the following: (i) the 
      accessory Sec components (SecA2, SecY2, and at least three accessory secretion 
      proteins), (ii) two essential glycosyltranferases (GTs) (GtfA and GtfB), (iii) a 
      variable number of dispensable additional GTs, and (iv) a secreted serine-rich LPXTG 
      protein which is glycosylated in the cytoplasm and transported to the cell surface 
      by this accessory Sec system. The secA2 locus of Streptococcus agalactiae strain 
      NEM316 is structurally related to those found in other streptococci and encodes the 
      serine-rich surface protein Srr1. We demonstrated that expression of Srr1 but not 
      that of the SecA2 components and the associated GTs is regulated by the standalone 
      transcriptional regulator Rga. Srr1 is synthesized as a glycosylated precursor, 
      secreted by the SecA2 system, and anchored to the cell wall by the housekeeping 
      sortase A. Srr1 was localized preferentially at the old poles. GtfA and/or GtfB, but 
      not the six additional GTs, is essential for the production of Srr1. These GTs are 
      involved in the attachment of GlcNac and sialic acid to Srr1. Full glycosylation of 
      Srr1 is associated with the cell surface display of a protein that is more resistant 
      to proteolytic attack. Srr1 contributes to bacterial adherence to human epithelial 
      cell lines and virulence in a neonatal rat model. The extent of Srr1 glycosylation 
      by GtfC to -H modulates bacterial adherence and virulence.

TI  - Investigations on the interactions of λphage-derived peptides against the SrtA 
      mechanism in Bacillus anthracis.
PG  - 1790-806
LID - 10.1007/s12010-013-0641-0 [doi]
AB  - Bacillus anthracis is a well-known bioweapon pathogen, which coordinates the 
      expression of its virulence factors in response to a specific environmental signal 
      by its protein architecture. Absences of sortase signal functioning may fail to 
      assemble the surface linked proteins and so B. anthracis cannot sustain an infection 
      with host cells. Targeting the signaling mechanism of B. anthracis can be achieved 
      by inhibition of SrtA enzyme through λphage-derived plyG. The lysin enzyme plyG is 
      experimentally proven as bacteriolytic agent, specifically kill's B. anthracis by 
      inhibiting the SrtA. Here, we have screened the peptides from λphage lysin, and 
      these peptides are having the ability as LPXTG competitive inhibitors. In comparison 
      to the activator peptide LPXTG binding motif, λphage lysin based inhibitor peptides 
      are having much supremacy towards binding of SrtA. Finally, peptide structures 
      extracted from PlyG are free from toxic, allergic abilities and also have the 
      ability to terminate the signal transduction mechanism in B. anthracis.

AB  - Analysis of the structural features of rhodopsin-type G-protein-coupled receptors 
      (GPCRs) revealed the existence of an additional α-helix, termed helix 8, in the 
      C-terminal tail. Furthermore, these GPCRs were determined to possess several 
      conserved residues in their transmembrane domains. The functional deficiencies of 
      receptors in which these domains or residues have been mutated have not been 
      examined in living cells due to their accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER), although the ligand affinities of these receptors have been tested in membrane 
      preparations. Recent studies have demonstrated that ER-accumulated receptors are 
      effectively exported from ER using membrane permeable ligands as pharmacological 
      chaperones. Here, we identified several residues of the platelet-activating factor 
      receptor and leukotriene B(4) type-II receptor that are crucial for export from ER. 
      Moreover, we used their specific ligands as pharmacological chaperones to traffic 
      ER-accumulated GPCRs to the cell surface in order to examine the functional 
      deficiencies of each mutant receptor. Here, we introduce the novel technique of 
      site-specific N-terminal labeling of cell surface proteins in living cells with 
      Sortase-A, a transpeptidase isolated from Staphylococcus aureus, to evaluate the 
      trafficking of receptors after agonist stimulation.

TI  - Dual role for pilus in adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm formation in 
      Streptococcus agalactiae.
PG  - e1000422
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000422 [doi]
LID - e1000422
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a common human commensal and a major life-threatening 
      pathogen in neonates. Adherence to host epithelial cells is the first critical step 
      of the infectious process. Pili have been observed on the surface of several 
      gram-positive bacteria including S. agalactiae. We previously characterized the 
      pilus-encoding operon gbs1479-1474 in strain NEM316. This pilus is composed of three 
      structural subunit proteins: Gbs1478 (PilA), Gbs1477 (PilB), and Gbs1474 (PilC), and 
      its assembly involves two class C sortases (SrtC3 and SrtC4). PilB, the bona fide 
      pilin, is the major component; PilA, the pilus associated adhesin, and PilC, are 
      both accessory proteins incorporated into the pilus backbone. We first addressed the 
      role of the housekeeping sortase A in pilus biogenesis and showed that it is 
      essential for the covalent anchoring of the pilus fiber to the peptidoglycan. We 
      next aimed at understanding the role of the pilus fiber in bacterial adherence and 
      at resolving the paradox of an adhesive but dispensable pilus. Combining 
      immunoblotting and electron microscopy analyses, we showed that the PilB fiber is 
      essential for efficient PilA display on the surface of the capsulated strain NEM316. 
      We then demonstrated that pilus integrity becomes critical for adherence to 
      respiratory epithelial cells under flow-conditions mimicking an in vivo situation 
      and revealing the limitations of the commonly used static adherence model. 
      Interestingly, PilA exhibits a von Willebrand adhesion domain (VWA) found in many 
      extracellular eucaryotic proteins. We show here that the VWA domain of PilA is 
      essential for its adhesive function, demonstrating for the first time the 
      functionality of a prokaryotic VWA homolog. Furthermore, the auto aggregative 
      phenotype of NEM316 observed in standing liquid culture was strongly reduced in all 
      three individual pilus mutants. S. agalactiae strain NEM316 was able to form biofilm 
      in microtiter plate and, strikingly, the PilA and PilB mutants were strongly 
      impaired in biofilm formation. Surprisingly, the VWA domain involved in adherence to 
      epithelial cells was not required for biofilm formation.

TI  - Focal targeting by human β-defensin 2 disrupts localized virulence factor assembly 
      sites in Enterococcus faecalis.
PG  - 20230-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1319066110 [doi]
AB  - Virulence factor secretion and assembly occurs at spatially restricted foci in some 
      Gram-positive bacteria. Given the essentiality of the general secretion pathway in 
      bacteria and the contribution of virulence factors to disease progression, the foci 
      that coordinate these processes are attractive antimicrobial targets. In this study, 
      we show in Enterococcus faecalis that SecA and Sortase A, required for the 
      attachment of virulence factors to the cell wall, localize to discrete domains near 
      the septum or nascent septal site as the bacteria proceed through the cell cycle. We 
      also demonstrate that cationic human β-defensins interact with E. faecalis at 
      discrete septal foci, and this exposure disrupts sites of localized secretion and 
      sorting. Modification of anionic lipids by multiple peptide resistance factor, a 
      protein that confers antimicrobial peptide resistance by electrostatic repulsion, 
      renders E. faecalis more resistant to killing by defensins and less susceptible to 
      focal targeting by the cationic antimicrobial peptides. These data suggest a 
      paradigm in which focal targeting by antimicrobial peptides is linked to their 
      killing efficiency and to disruption of virulence factor assembly.

      srtA].
PG  - 399-401
AB  - AIM: To elucidate the distribution of srt gene in the genome of S.suis 05ZYH33, 
      prokaryotically express Sortase A and analyze its antigenicity. METHODS: Homologous 
      genes encoding sortase family members were analyzed, and then the srtA gene of 
      S.suis was cloned and sequenced. The recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE 
      and Western blot. The mice were immunized with recombinant protein and the antibody 
      titer was determined by indirect ELISA. RESULTS: All the putative srt genes in the 
      genome of 05ZYH33 were analyzed. Six genes were found to be homologous to srt of 
      S.suis isolated in Japan. The predicted srtA and sortase-like proteins were members 
      of Class A of sortase family while srtBCD and srtE belonged to Class B. Western blot 
      analysis showed that the recombinant protein was reactive to with the serum from the 
      rabbits infected with a virulent strain of S.suis Type 2. The antibody titer in 
      blood serum reached 1:6 400 after immunization with recombinant protein four times. 
      CONCLUSION: Compared with the isolated strain from Japan a new putative srt gene was 
      found in 05ZYH33. The srtA gene was successfully expressed in prokaryotic system and 
      the recombinant protein showed specific antigenicity, which is important for future 
      research of the function of Sortase.

AB  - L-Threonine 2 was converted in seven steps into the protected aminomercaptoalcohol 
      8, a threonine mimic. This compound 8 was coupled to various oligopeptides to 
      produce two different tetrapeptide analogues, for example, 11 and 17, which were 
      shown to inhibit the Sortase enzymes (SrtA and SrtB) via covalent attachment of the 
      thiol groups of 11 and 17 to the catalytically active cysteine residue of the 
      Sortase enzymes.

TI  - Cell wall antibiotics provoke accumulation of anchored mCherry in the cross wall of 
      Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - e30076
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0030076 [doi]
LID - e30076
AB  - A fluorescence microscopy method to directly follow the localization of defined 
      proteins in Staphylococcus was hampered by the unstable fluorescence of fluorescent 
      proteins. Here, we constructed plasmid (pCX) encoded red fluorescence (RF) mCherry 
      (mCh) hybrids, namely mCh-cyto (no signal peptide and no sorting sequence), mCh-sec 
      (with signal peptide), and mCh-cw (with signal peptide and cell wall sorting 
      sequence). The S. aureus clones targeted mCh-fusion proteins into the cytosol, the 
      supernatant and the cell envelope respectively; in all cases mCherry exhibited 
      bright fluorescence. In staphylococci two types of signal peptides (SP) can be 
      distinguished: the +YSIRK motif SP(lip) and the -YSIRK motif SP(sasF). mCh-hybrids 
      supplied with the +YSIRK motif SP(lip) were always expressed higher than those with 
      -YSIRK motif SP(sasF). To study the location of the anchoring process and also the 
      influence of SP type, mCh-cw was supplied on the one hand with +YSIRK motif 
      (mCh-cw1) and the other hand with -YSIRK motif (mCh-cw2). MCh-cw1 preferentially 
      localized at the cross wall, while mCh-cw2 preferentially localized at the 
      peripheral wall. Interestingly, when treated with sub-lethal concentrations of 
      penicillin or moenomycin, both mCh-cw1 and mCh-cw2 were concentrated at the cross 
      wall. The shift from the peripheral wall to the cross wall required Sortase A 
      (SrtA), as in the srtA mutant this effect was blunted. The effect is most likely due 
      to antibiotic mediated increase of free anchoring sites (Lipid II) at the cross 
      wall, the substrate of SrtA, leading to a preferential incorporation of anchored 
      proteins at the cross wall.

TI  - [Cloning and expression of the novel antimicrobial target enzyme Sortase gene in two 
      prokaryotic vectors].
PG  - 186-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sortase is a novel anti-infection target enzyme for its critical action 
      of anchoring surface proteins to the cell wall. METHODS: We amplified the srtA gene 
      from Staphylococcus aureus chromosomal DNA by PCR technique, and then constructed 
      two prokaryotic expression vectors pet22-srtA and pTRX-srtA with regular molecular 
      cloning operation. The pet22-srtA and pTRX-srtA were transformed into Eschericheria 
      coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells and overexpressed under 1 mmol/L IPTG 
      (isopropy-beta-D-thiogalactoside) induction. RESULTS: SDS-PAGE and western blot 
      results show that approximately 45 kDa and 39 kDa proteins were expressed by 
      pet22-srtA and pTRX-srtA respectively. CONCLUSION: The molecular chaperone 
      thioredoxin was beneficial to the prokaryotic expression of srtA gene. Moreover, the 
      experiment laid solid foundation to study sortase's enzymatic property and 
      inhibitors screening especially.

AB  - Here, we report the development of a method for three-fragment assemblies of 
      semisynthetic proteins by combining sortase-mediated ligation with site-specific 
      bioconjugation catalyzed by the 4'-phosphopantetheine transferase Sfp. This method 
      enables the introduction of synthetic peptides into central regions of proteins 
      without the need to purify intermediates. The assembled proteins are linked at the 
      N-terminal junction with a 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety and with a peptide bond at 
      the C-terminal ligation site. We have demonstrated the applicability of this method 
      by assembling a semisynthetic model protein derived from fluorescence resonance 
      energy transfer-based reporters from three fragments in a one-pot reaction.

TI  - Establishment of an experimental system allowing immobilization of proteins on the 
      surface of Bacillus subtilis cells.
PG  - 473-82
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria code for one or more enzymes termed sortases which catalyze 
      the covalent anchoring of substrate proteins on their cell wall. They recognize an 
      amino acid sequence designated sorting motif, present close to the C-terminal end of 
      the substrate proteins, cleave within this motif and catalyze anchoring of the 
      polypeptide chain to the peptide crossbridge linking the peptidoglycan strands in a 
      transpeptidation reaction. Bacillus subtilis has been reported to code for two 
      different sortases but the sorting sequences recognized by them are yet unknown. To 
      be able to immobilize proteins on the surface of B. subtilis cells, we introduced 
      the srtA gene coding for sortase A of Listeria monocytogenes with the known sorting 
      motif (LPXTG) into B. subtilis. L. monocytogenes and B. subtilis share the same 
      peptide crossbridge. Next, we fused the coding region of an alpha-amylase gene to 
      the C-terminal region of Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein B 
      containing the sorting motif. Covalent linkage could be proven by treatment of the 
      cells with lysozyme and by immunofluorescence microscopy. Up to 240,000 molecules of 
      alpha-amylase could be immobilized per cell, 24 times more than previously reported 
      for other bacterial species. To study the influence of the distance between the 
      sorting motif and the C-terminus of alpha-amylase on the activity of the enzyme, the 
      length of the spacer was varied. It turned out that the highest activity was 
      measured with a spacer length of 123 amino acid residues.

AB  - K-Ras4B, a small GTPase and a key oncogene, plays a central role in the early steps 
      of signal transduction from activated receptor tyrosine kinases by recruiting its 
      downstream effectors to the cell membrane. Specific posttranslational modifications 
      of K-Ras4B, including the addition of C-terminal farnesyl and methyl groups, mediate 
      its proper membrane localization and signaling activity. The mechanism and molecular 
      determinants underlying this selective membrane localization and molecular 
      interactions with its many regulators and downstream effectors are largely unknown. 
      Preparative amounts of the posttranslationally processed K-Ras4B protein are 
      necessary to carry out structural, functional, and cell biological studies of this 
      important oncogene. In this work we describe a simple and efficient method for 
      synthesis of milligram quantities of functionally active, fully processed K-Ras4B. 
      Using this preparation, we observe K-Ras4B dimerization in vitro; this has not been 
      observed previously and could be important for its activity, membrane anchoring, and 
      translocation between different cellular membranes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct srtA-gene deletion mutant of Streptococcus mutans (S. 
      mutans) UA159 with IFDC2 cassette through overlapping polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) and allelic homologous recombination. METHODS: First, the upstream and 
      downstream fragments surrounding the srtA and IFDC2 cassette were PCR amplified and 
      ligated through overlapping PCR. The resulting amplicon was transformed into UA159, 
      and positive transformants were selected on BHI plates containing erythromycin. 
      Second, upstream and downstream fragments of srtA with overlap regions were 
      generated by PCR and were overlapped to create upΔ-down amplicon. Then, the upΔ-down 
      amplicon was transformed into the aforementioned positive transformants and selected 
      on BHI plates containing p-Cl-Phe. RESULTS: The PCR analysis and DNA sequencing 
      results indicated that the coding region of the srtA was completely deleted, and the 
      upstream and downstream regions flanking the srtA were ligated seamlessly. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The markerless srtA-deletion mutant of S. mutans was constructed 
      successfully, which laid a foundation for further study of its biological function 
      and influence on the biofilm formation of S. mutans.

AB  - Nine new compounds, tris-aromatic furanones (1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4) and related 
      bis-aromatic diesters (5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b), are described from the ascidian Synoicum 
      sp. collected off the coast of Chuja-do, Korea. The structures of these compounds, 
      designated as cadiolides E and G-I (1-4) and synoilides A and B (5 and 6), were 
      determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses. The absolute configuration at the 
      asymmetric center of cadiolide G (2) was assigned by ECD analysis. Of these new 
      compounds, cadiolide I and the synoilides possess unprecedented carbon skeletons. 
      Several of these compounds exhibited significant inhibition against diverse 
      bacterial strains as well as moderate inhibition against the enzymes sortase A, 
      isocitrate lyase, and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase.

LID - 10.1007/s10529-011-0637-1 [doi]
AB  - A novel growth factor containing non-canonical amino acids was designed and 
      synthesized to enhance the binding to hydroxyapatite (HA). The designed protein was 
      human bone morphogenetic protein 4 (hBMP4) incorporating diphosporylated serines 
      (pSpS) that was found in salivary protein statherin and was reported to be 
      responsible for binding to HA. Recombinant hBMP4 and a short peptide sequences 
      containing pSpS were ligated by enzymatice reaction of sortase A, which exchanges 
      the terminal amino acids of two polypeptides. Resulting hBMP4 containing pSpS 
      (hBMP4-pSpS) bound HA more efficiently than hBMP-4 tagged with canonical serines 
      (hBMP4-SS). The HA-bound hBMP-4-pSpS exhibited osteogenesis inducing activity to 
      multipotential mesenchyme cells (C3H10T1/2) as evidenced by increased expression of 
      osteogenic markers, which was not seen by hBMP4-SS. This novel protein with 
      non-canonical serines will be applicable to bone regeneration materials in 
      combination with HA.

TI  - Importance of srtA and srtB for growth of Bacillus anthracis in macrophages.
PG  - 5222-8
AB  - We examined the effect of mutation of two sortase genes of Bacillus anthracis, srtA 
      and srtB, on the ability of the bacterium to grow in J774A.1 cells, a mouse 
      macrophage-like cell line. While disruption of either srtA or srtB had no effect on 
      the ability of the bacteria to grow in rich culture media, mutations in each of 
      these genes dramatically attenuated growth of the bacterium in J774A.1 cells. 
      Complementation of the mutation restored the ability of bacteria to grow in the 
      cells. Since the initial events in inhalation anthrax are believed to be uptake of 
      B. anthracis spores by alveolar macrophages followed by germination of the spores 
      and growth of the bacteria within the macrophages, these results suggest that two 
      sortases of B. anthracis may be critical in the early stages of inhalation anthrax.

TI  - Inactivation of the srtA gene affects localization of surface proteins and decreases 
      adhesion of Streptococcus pneumoniae to human pharyngeal cells in vitro.
PG  - 2758-65
AB  - Inactivation of sortase gene srtA in Streptococcus pneumoniae strain R6 caused the 
      release of beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase A (NanA) from the cell wall into the 
      surrounding medium. Both of these surface proteins contain the LPXTG motif in the 
      C-terminal domain. Complementation with plasmid-borne srtA reversed protein release. 
      Deletion of murM, a gene involved in the branching of pneumococcal peptidoglycan, 
      also caused partial release of beta-galactosidase, suggesting preferential 
      attachment of the protein to branched muropeptides in the cell wall. Inactivation of 
      srtA caused decreased adherence to human pharyngeal cells in vitro but had no effect 
      on the virulence of a capsular type III strain of S. pneumoniae in the mouse 
      intraperitoneal model. The observations suggest that--as in other gram-positive 
      bacteria--sortase-dependent display of proteins occurs in S. pneumoniae and that 
      some of these proteins may be involved in colonization of the human host.

TI  - Allelic variation in srtAs of Streptococcus suis strains.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - Streptococcus suis NCTC10234 possesses five srtA homologs: srtA encodes sortase, 
      which anchors surface proteins with an LPXTG motif to the cell wall, while the 
      functions of the other four homologs (the srtBCD cluster and srtE) remain unknown. 
      The genetic organization of the srtA region was found to be conserved in the 59 S. 
      suis strains examined in this study. Although the srtAs in three of these strains 
      showed strong sequence divergence, their functions were verified to be overlapping 
      by genetic complementation, indicating the functional conservation of srtAs during 
      the evolution of these strains. These results indicate the importance of an 
      srtA-mediated cell wall sorting system for displaying proteins on the surface of S. 
      suis.

TI  - Communication of γ phage lysin plyG enzymes binding toward SrtA for inhibition of 
      Bacillus anthracis: protein-protein interaction and molecular dynamics study.
PG  - 257-65
LID - 10.3109/15419061.2014.927444 [doi]
AB  - Bacillus anthracis is a pathogenic, Gram-positive bacterium which chiefly affects 
      the livestock of animals and humans through acute disease anthrax. All around the 
      globe this bio-threat organism damages millions of lives in every year and also most 
      of the drugs were not responding properly in inhibition against this diseased 
      pathogen. In recent development, phage therapy is considered as alternative solution 
      to treat this serious infectious disease. In this study, we elucidated the binding 
      of γ phage lysin plyG enzymes toward the SrtA along with its activator peptide 
      LPXTG. Through protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, we 
      showed the distinguished structure complementarity of SrtA and plyG complex. 
      Especially, MD simulation relates strong and stable interaction occurs between the 
      protein complex structures. These results suggest that additional experimental 
      studies on our approach will lead to availability of better inhibitor against the 
      SrtA.

PG  - 75-80
AB  - The srtA gene product, SrtA, has been shown to be required for cell wall anchoring 
      of protein A as well as virulence in the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. 
      There are five major mechanisms for displaying proteins at the surface of 
      gram-positive bacteria (P. Cossart and R. Jonquieres, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 
      97:5013-5015, 2000). However, since many of the known surface proteins of 
      gram-positive bacteria are believed to be exported and anchored via the sortase 
      pathway, it was of interest to determine if srtA plays a similar role in other 
      gram-positive bacteria. To that end, the srtA gene in the human oral commensal 
      organism Streptococcus gordonii was insertionally inactivated. The srtA mutant S. 
      gordonii exhibited a marked reduction in quantity of a specific anchored surface 
      protein. Furthermore, the srtA mutant had reduced binding to immobilized human 
      fibronectin and had a decreased ability to colonize the oral mucosa of mice. Taken 
      together, these results suggest that the activity of SrtA plays an important role in 
      the biology of nonpathogenic as well as pathogenic gram-positive cocci.

      mice.
PG  - 95-103

AB  - Sortase A (SrtA), a transpeptidase, anchors surface proteins with an LPXTG-motif 
      sorting signal to the cell envelope. To determine the role of SrtA in the 
      pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus, we constructed a mutant strain, ∆SrtA, by 
      genetic techniques and identified its functions in a S. aureus-induced mastitis 
      mouse model. The histological and myeloperoxidase (MPO) level results showed that 
      the ∆SrtA strain attenuated the inflammatory reaction in the mammary tissue of mice 
      compared with wild-type S. aureus challenge. Additionally, the ELISA results showed 
      that the ∆SrtA strain impaired the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as 
      tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
      and the Western blot results showed that the mutant strain blocked the activation of 
      nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) by 
      attenuating the degradation and phosphorylation of signaling pathway molecules such 
      as IκBα, p65 and p38. These results suggest that SrtA is a key virulence factor in 
      the pathogenesis of S. aureus-induced mastitis in mice. It appears that the srtA 
      mutant affected the attachment of S. aureus to host cells, thus attenuating the 
      activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, which regulated the expression 
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased the susceptibility to mastitis.

PG  - 56-66
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00592 [doi]
AB  - The conjugation of antibodies to drugs and drug carriers improves delivery to target 
      tissues. Widespread implementation and effective translation of this pharmacologic 
      strategy awaits the development of affinity ligands capable of a defined degree of 
      modification and highly efficient bioconjugation without loss of affinity. To date, 
      such ligands are lacking for the targeting of therapeutics to vascular endothelial 
      cells. To enable site-specific, click-chemistry conjugation to therapeutic cargo, we 
      used the bacterial transpeptidase, sortase A, to attach short azidolysine containing 
      peptides to three endothelial-specific single chain antibody fragments (scFv). While 
      direct fusion of a recognition motif (sortag) to the scFv C-terminus generally 
      resulted in low levels of sortase-mediated modification, improved reaction 
      efficiency was observed for one protein, in which two amino acids had been 
      introduced during cloning. This prompted insertion of a short, semi-rigid linker 
      between scFv and sortag. The linker significantly enhanced modification of all three 
      proteins, to the extent that unmodified scFv could no longer be detected. As proof 
      of principle, purified, azide-modified scFv was conjugated to the antioxidant 
      enzyme, catalase, resulting in robust endothelial targeting of functional cargo in 
      vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Common protein purification processes rely on noncovalent affinity binding of the 
      target protein to resin via fusion tags, which has limitations such as leakage of 
      target during the removal of impurities, restricting stringency of wash conditions, 
      and often requires postpurification removal of tags. Here, we developed the Catch, 
      Hold, and Release (C-H-R) method by bioengineering a single-use resin composed of 
      polyhydroxybutyrate beads codisplaying two SpyCatcher (SpyC) domains and Sortase A 
      (SrtA). This core-shell resin was assembled by engineered Escherichia coli. 
      SpyTagged (SpyT) targets with a SrtA cleavage site after SpyT were specifically 
      ligated to SpyC, while inducible SrtA catalyzed the release of the pure tagless 
      target. SpyT remained covalently bound to the resin. Three diverse proteins were 
      isolated from complex mixtures with high purity and yields. The C-H-R bioseparation 
      method uses an innovative resin engaging a covalent link to the target and an 
      inducible proximal SrtA as a protein purification concept.

TI  - Efficient Sortase-Mediated Ligation Using a Common C-Terminal Fusion Tag.
PG  - 1463-1473
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.0c00156 [doi]
AB  - Sortase-mediated ligation is a powerful method for generating site-specifically 
      modified proteins. However, this process is limited by the inherent reversibility of 
      the ligation reaction. To address this, here we report the continued development and 
      optimization of an experimentally facile strategy for blocking reaction 
      reversibility. This approach, which we have termed metal-assisted sortase-mediated 
      ligation (MA-SML), relies on the use of a solution additive (Ni(2+)) and a 
      C-terminal tag (LPXTGGHH(5)) that is widely used for converting protein targets into 
      sortase substrates. In a series of model systems utilizing a 1:1 molar ratio of 
      sortase substrate and glycine amine nucleophile, we find that MA-SML consistently 
      improves the extent of ligation. This enables the modification of proteins with 
      fluorophores, PEG, and a bioorthogonal cyclooctyne moiety without the need to use 
      precious reagents in excess. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of 
      MA-SML as a general strategy for improving reaction efficiency in a broad range of 
      sortase-based protein engineering applications.

      modified cholera toxin.

AB  - We describe a novel labeling strategy to site-specifically attach fluorophores, 
      biotin, and proteins to the C terminus of the A1 subunit (CTA1) of cholera toxin 
      (CTx) in an otherwise correctly assembled and active CTx complex. Using a 
      biotinylated N-linked glycosylation reporter peptide attached to CTA1, we provide 
      direct evidence that ~12% of the internalized CTA1 pool reaches the ER. We also 
      explored the sortase labeling method to attach the catalytic subunit of diphtheria 
      toxin as a toxic warhead to CTA1, thus converting CTx into a cytolethal toxin. This 
      new toxin conjugate enabled us to conduct a genetic screen in human cells, which 
      identified ST3GAL5, SLC35A2, B3GALT4, UGCG, and ELF4 as genes essential for CTx 
      intoxication. The first four encode proteins involved in the synthesis of 
      gangliosides, which are known receptors for CTx. Identification and isolation of the 
      ST3GAL5 and SLC35A2 mutant clonal cells uncover a previously unappreciated 
      differential contribution of gangliosides to intoxication by CTx.

TI  - A novel sortase, SrtC2, from Streptococcus pyogenes anchors a surface protein 
      containing a QVPTGV motif to the cell wall.
PG  - 5865-75
AB  - The important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus GAS), 
      requires several surface proteins to interact with its human host. Many of these are 
      covalently linked by a sortase enzyme to the cell wall via a C-terminal LPXTG motif. 
      This motif is followed by a hydrophobic region and charged C terminus, which are 
      thought to retard the protein in the cell membrane to facilitate recognition by the 
      membrane-localized sortase. Previously, we identified two sortase enzymes in GAS. 
      SrtA is found in all GAS strains and anchors most proteins containing LPXTG, while 
      SrtB is present only in some strains and anchors a subset of LPXTG-containing 
      proteins. We now report the presence of a third sortase in most strains of GAS, 
      SrtC. We show that SrtC mediates attachment of a protein with a QVPTGV motif 
      preceding a hydrophobic region and charged tail. We also demonstrate that the QVPTGV 
      sequence is a substrate for anchoring of this protein by SrtC. Furthermore, 
      replacing this motif with LPSTGE, found in the SrtA-anchored M protein of GAS, leads 
      to SrtA-dependent secretion of the protein but does not lead to its anchoring by 
      SrtA. We conclude that srtC encodes a novel sortase that anchors a protein 
      containing a QVPTGV motif to the surface of GAS.

TI  - Vinyl sulfones: inhibitors of SrtA, a transpeptidase required for cell wall protein 
      anchoring and virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 3404-5
AB  - Several small molecule vinyl sulfones were found to exhibit irreversible 
      time-dependent inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus sortase SrtA in vitro. A 
      representative of these compounds was shown to impair the ability of S. aureus 
      bacteria to bind fibronectin-coated surfaces through in vivo inhibition of 
      SrtA-mediated linkage of fibronectin to the cell surface. These data highlight the 
      potential use of small molecule vinyl sulfones as chemotherapeutics to prevent 
      adhesion to and colonization of host tissues during S. aureus infection.

TI  - Assembly of pili on the surface of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
PG  - 1429-38
AB  - Pili of Gram-negative pathogens are formed from pilin precursor molecules by 
      non-covalent association within the outer membrane envelope. Gram-positive microbes 
      employ the cell wall peptidoglycan as a surface organelle for the covalent 
      attachment of proteins, however, an assembly pathway for pili has not yet been 
      revealed. We show here that pili of Corynebacterium diphtheriae are composed of 
      three pilin subunits, SpaA, SpaB and SpaC. SpaA, the major pilin protein, is 
      distributed uniformly along the pilus shaft, whereas SpaB is observed at regular 
      intervals and SpaC seems positioned at the pilus tip. Assembled pili are released 
      from the bacterial surface by treatment with murein hydrolase, suggesting that the 
      pilus fibres may be anchored to the cell wall envelope. All three pilin subunit 
      proteins are synthesized as precursors carrying N-terminal signal peptides and 
      C-terminal sorting signals. Some, but not all, of the six sortase genes encoded in 
      the genome of C. diphtheriae are required for precursor processing, pilus assembly 
      or cell wall envelope attachment. Pilus assembly is proposed to occur by a mechanism 
      of ordered cross-linking, whereby pilin-specific sortase enzymes cleave precursor 
      proteins at sorting signals and involve the side chain amino groups of pilin motif 
      sequences to generate links between pilin subunits. This covalent tethering of 
      adjacent pilin subunits appears to have evolved in many Gram-positive pathogens that 
      encode sortase and pilin subunit genes with sorting signals and pilin motifs.

TI  - Passage of heme-iron across the envelope of Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 906-9
AB  - The cell wall envelope of Gram-positive pathogens functions as a scaffold for the 
      attachment of virulence factors and as a sieve that prevents diffusion of molecules. 
      Here the isd genes (iron-regulated surface determinant) of Staphylococcus aureus 
      were found to encode factors responsible for hemoglobin binding and passage of 
      heme-iron to the cytoplasm, where it acts as an essential nutrient. Heme-iron 
      passage required two sortases that tether Isd proteins to unique locations within 
      the cell wall. Thus, Isd appears to act as an import apparatus that uses cell 
      wall-anchored proteins to relay heme-iron across the bacterial envelope.

AB  - The development of SrtA inhibitors targeting the biothreat organism namely Bacillus 
      anthracis was achieved by the combined approach of pharmacophore modeling, binding 
      interactions, electron transferring capacity, ADME, and Molecular dynamics studies. 
      In this study, experimentally reported Ba-SrtA inhibitors (pyridazinone and 
      pyrazolethione derivatives) were considered for the development of enhanced 
      pharmacophoric model. The obtained AAAHR hypothesis was a pure theoretical concept 
      that accounts for common molecular interaction network present in experimentally 
      active pyridazinone and pyrazolethione derivatives. Pharmacophore-based screening of 
      AAAHR hypothesis provides several new compounds, and those compounds were treated 
      with four phases of docking protocols with combined Glide-QPLD docking approach. In 
      this approach, scoring and charge accuracy variations were seen to be dominated by 
      QM/MM approach through the allocation of partial charges. Finally, we reported the 
      best compounds from binding db, Chembridge db, and Toslab based on scoring values, 
      energy parameters, electron transfer reaction, ADME, and cell adhesion inhibition 
      activity. The dynamic state of interaction and binding energy assess that new 
      compounds are more active inside the binding pocket and these compounds on 
      experimental validations will survive as better inhibitors for targeting the cell 
      adhesion mechanism of Ba-SrtA.

TI  - Production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli using an N-terminal tag 
      derived from sortase.
PG  - 143-50
LID - 10.1016/j.pep.2009.10.012 [doi]
AB  - The use of Escherichia coli protein expression systems has many benefits, including 
      the ease of propagation, amounts of protein that can be generated and cost. However, 
      this host has some drawbacks due to difficulties in the production of soluble 
      foreign proteins with their alternate codon usage bias, reductive cytoplasmic 
      environment and lack of complex post-translational modifications. We have designed a 
      novel fusion protein tag derived from the sequence of sortase (SrtA) which we have 
      named Solubility 'eNhancing'Ubiquitous Tag (SNUT). Here we demonstrate its 
      application and effectiveness as an N-terminal fusion tag for the expression and 
      purification of proteins that could not be effectively produced with other tags. We 
      show this tag can be utilized for the purification of proteins through both native 
      and refolding immobilized metal ion chromatography and in combination with an 
      anti-SNUT monoclonal antibody, can also be used as a detection tag. This tag may 
      prove useful in circumventing expression and purification issues with the production 
      of proteins in bacterial expression hosts.

TI  - Protein cell surface display in Gram-positive bacteria: from single protein to 
      macromolecular protein structure.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - In the course of evolution, Gram-positive bacteria, defined here as prokaryotes from 
      the domain Bacteria with a cell envelope composed of one biological membrane 
      (monodermita) and a cell wall composed at least of peptidoglycan and covalently 
      linked teichoic acids, have developed several mechanisms permitting to a cytoplasmic 
      synthesized protein to be present on the bacterial cell surface. Four major types of 
      cell surface displayed proteins are currently recognized: (i) transmembrane 
      proteins, (ii) lipoproteins, (iii) LPXTG-like proteins and (iv) cell wall binding 
      proteins. The subset of proteins exposed on the bacterial cell surface, and thus 
      interacting with extracellular milieu, constitutes the surfaceome. Here, we review 
      exhaustively the current molecular mechanisms involved in protein attachment within 
      the cell envelope of Gram-positive bacteria, from single protein to macromolecular 
      protein structure.

TI  - Assembly of distinct pilus structures on the surface of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
PG  - 1526-33
AB  - Different surface organelles contribute to specific interactions of a pathogen with 
      host tissues or infectious partners. Multiple pilus gene clusters potentially 
      encoding different surface structures have been identified in several gram-positive 
      bacterial genomes sequenced to date, including actinomycetales, clostridia, 
      corynebacteria, and streptococci. Corynebacterium diphtheriae has been shown to 
      assemble a pilus structure, with sortase SrtA essential for the assembly of a major 
      subunit SpaA and two minor proteins, SpaB and SpaC. We report here the 
      characterization of a second pilus consisting of SpaD, SpaE, and SpaF, of which SpaD 
      and SpaE form the pilus shaft and SpaF may be located at the pilus tip. The 
      structure of the SpaDEF pilus contains no SpaABC pilins as detected by 
      immunoelectron microscopy. Neither deletion of spaA nor sortase srtA abolishes 
      SpaDEF pilus formation. The assembly of the SpaDEF pilus requires specific sortases 
      located within the SpaDEF pilus gene cluster. Although either sortase SrtB or SrtC 
      is sufficient to polymerize SpaDF, the incorporation of SpaE into the SpaD pili 
      requires sortase SrtB. In addition, an alanine in place of the lysine of the SpaD 
      pilin motif abrogates pilus polymerization. Thus, SpaD, SpaE, and SpaF constitute a 
      different pilus structure that is independently assembled and morphologically 
      distinct from the SpaABC pili and possibly other pili of C. diphtheriae.

TI  - LPXTG protein InlJ, a newly identified internalin involved in Listeria monocytogenes 
      virulence.
PG  - 6912-22
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes expresses surface proteins covalently anchored to the 
      peptidoglycan by sortase enzymes. Inactivation of srtA attenuates Listeria virulence 
      in mice (H. Bierne, S. K. Mazmanian, M. Trost, M. G. Pucciarelli, G. Liu, P. Dehoux, 
      L. Jansch, F. Garcia-del Portillo, O. Schneewind, and P. Cossart, Mol. Microbiol. 
      43:869-881, 2002). We show here that an srtA mutant is more attenuated than an 
      internalin mutant in orally infected guinea pigs and transgenic mice expressing 
      human E-cadherin (hEcad mice), indicating the involvement of other SrtA substrates, 
      LPXTG proteins, in food-borne listeriosis. Data recently generated with a listerial 
      DNA macroarray identified two LPXTG protein-encoding genes present in the genomes of 
      L. monocytogenes strains and absent from all other Listeria species, inlI (lmo0333) 
      and inlJ (lmo2821). They also revealed two other LPXTG protein-encoding genes, ORF29 
      and ORF2568, present only in a subclass of L. monocytogenes serovars, including the 
      epidemic serovar 4b. We report here that an inlJ deletion mutant, in contrast to 
      inlI and ORF29 mutants, is significantly attenuated in virulence after intravenous 
      infection of mice or oral inoculation of hEcad mice. Interestingly, a DeltaORF2568 
      strain showed a slight increase in virulence. inlJ encodes a leucine-rich repeat 
      (LRR) protein that is structurally related to the listerial invasion factor 
      internalin. However, the consensus sequence of the InlJ LRR defines a novel 
      subfamily of cysteine-containing LRRs in bacteria. In conclusion, this postgenomic 
      approach identified InlJ as a new virulence factor among the proteins belonging to 
      the internalin family in L. monocytogenes.

TI  - Protein sorting to the cell wall envelope of Gram-positive bacteria.
PG  - 269-78
AB  - The covalent anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall envelope of 
      Gram-positive bacteria occurs by a universal mechanism requiring sortases, 
      extracellular transpeptidases that are positioned in the plasma membrane. Surface 
      protein precursors are first initiated into the secretory pathway of Gram-positive 
      bacteria via N-terminal signal peptides. C-terminal sorting signals of surface 
      proteins, bearing an LPXTG motif or other recognition sequences, provide for 
      sortase-mediated cleavage and acyl enzyme formation, a thioester linkage between the 
      active site cysteine residue of sortase and the C-terminal carboxyl group of cleaved 
      surface proteins. During cell wall anchoring, sortase acyl enzymes are resolved by 
      the nucleophilic attack of peptidoglycan substrates, resulting in amide bond 
      formation between the C-terminal end of surface proteins and peptidoglycan 
      cross-bridges within the bacterial cell wall envelope. The genomes of Gram-positive 
      bacteria encode multiple sortase genes. Recent evidence suggests that sortase 
      enzymes catalyze protein anchoring reactions of multiple different substrate classes 
      with different sorting signal motif sequences, protein linkage to unique cell wall 
      anchor structures as well as protein polymerization leading to the formation of pili 
      on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - The structure of sortase B, a cysteine transpeptidase that tethers surface protein 
      to the Staphylococcus aureus cell wall.
PG  - 105-12
AB  - Many surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, which play important roles during 
      the pathogenesis of human infections, are anchored to the cell wall envelope by a 
      mechanism requiring sortases. Sortase B, a cysteine transpeptidase from 
      Staphylococcus aureus, cleaves the C-terminal sorting signal of IsdC at the NPQTN 
      motif and tethers the polypeptide to the pentaglycine cell wall cross-bridge. During 
      catalysis, the active site cysteine of sortase and the cleaved substrate form an 
      acyl intermediate, which is then resolved by the amino group of pentaglycine 
      cross-bridges. We report here the crystal structures of SrtBDeltaN30 in complex with 
      two active site inhibitors, MTSET and E64, and with the cell wall substrate analog 
      tripleglycine. These structures reveal, for the first time, the active site 
      disposition and the unique Cys-Arg catalytic machinery of the cysteine 
      transpeptidase, and they also provide useful information for the future design of 
      anti-infective agents against sortases.

AB  - Sortase (SrtA), an enzyme that anchors surface proteins to the cell wall of 
      Gram-positive bacteria, cleaves sorting signals at the LPXTG motif. We have 
      identified a second sortase (SrtB) in the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus 
      aureus that is required for anchoring of a surface protein with a NPQTN motif. 
      Purified SrtB cleaves NPQTN-bearing peptides in vitro, and a srtB mutant is 
      defective in the persistence of animal infections. srtB is part of an iron-regulated 
      locus called iron-responsive surface determinants (isd), which also contains a 
      ferrichrome transporter and surface proteins with NPQTN and LPXTG motifs. Cell 
      wall-anchored surface proteins and the isd locus seem involved in a novel mechanism 
      of iron acquisition that is important for bacterial pathogenesis.

AB  - The emergence and wide spread of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. 
      aureus) requires the development of new therapeutic agents with alternative modes of 
      action. Anti-virulence strategies are hoped to meet that need. Sortase A (SrtA) has 
      attracted great interest as a potential drug target to treat infections caused by S. 
      aureus, as many of the surface proteins displayed by SrtA function as virulence 
      factors by mediating bacterial adhesion to specific organ tissues, invasion of host 
      cells, and evasion of the host-immune responses. It has been suggested that 
      inhibitors of SrtA might be promising candidates for the treatment and/or prevention 
      of S. aureus infections. In this study, we report that chlorogenic acid (CHA), a 
      natural compound that lacks significant anti-S. aureus activity, inhibit the 
      activity of SrtA in vitro (IC50 = 33.86 ± 5.55 μg/ml) and the binding of S. aureus 
      to fibrinogen (Fg). Using molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays, we 
      further demonstrate that CHA binds to the binding sites of C184 and G192 in the 
      SrtA. In vivo studies demonstrated that CHA prevent mice from S. aureus-induced 
      renal abscess, resulting in a significant survival advantage. These findings 
      indicate that CHA is a promising therapeutic compound against SrtA during S. aureus 
      infections.

TI  - Eriodictyol as a Potential Candidate Inhibitor of Sortase A Protects Mice From 
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus-Induced Pneumonia.
PG  - 635710
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.635710 [doi]
LID - 635710
AB  - New anti-infective approaches are urgently needed to control multidrug-resistant 
      (MDR) pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Sortase 
      A (SrtA) is a membrane-bound cysteine transpeptidase that plays an essential role in 
      the catalysis of covalent anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of 
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The present study reports identification of a 
      flavonoid, eriodictyol, as a reversible inhibitor of SrtA with an IC(50) of 2.229 ± 
      0.014 μg/mL that can be used as an innovative means to counter both resistance and 
      virulence. The data indicated that eriodictyol inhibited the adhesion of the 
      bacteria to fibrinogen and reduced the formation of biofilms and anchoring of 
      staphylococcal protein A (SpA) on the cell wall. The results of fluorescence 
      quenching experiments demonstrated a strong interaction between eriodictyol and 
      SrtA. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that eriodictyol binds to SrtA by 
      interacting with R197 amino acid residue. Importantly, eriodictyol reduced the 
      adhesion-dependent invasion of A549 cells by S. aureus and showed a good therapeutic 
      effect in a model of mouse pneumonia induced by S. aureus. Overall, the results 
      indicated that eriodictyol can attenuate MRSA virulence and prevent the development 
      of resistance by inhibiting SrtA, suggesting that eriodictyol may be a promising 
      lead compound for the control of MRSA infections.

AB  - A tetrameric streptavidin (SA)-appended LPETG tag was site-specifically linked to 
      azido-containing tri-glycine via sortase A catalysis and the resulting 
      azido-modified SA (SA-N3) was retained in the biotin-binding pocket. SA-N3 was 
      polymerized with dibenzylcyclooctyne-modified branched poly(ethyleneglycol) 
      (DBCO-PEG) using azido-modified branched PEG (N3-PEG) as a spacer via copper-free 
      click chemistry. The resulting SA-based hydrogel exhibited gel-like mechanical 
      properties and could immobilize biotin-modified molecules through biotin-SA 
      affinity. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was immobilized in the SA-based hydrogel, and 
      the hydrogel was then coated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and used for the 
      biocatalytic oxidation of glucose. The designed GCE exhibited better performance and 
      stability compared with GDH chemically adsorbed onto a GCE. In addition, the 
      designed GCE anode and a Pt-carbon cathode were assembled into a glucose/O(2) fuel 
      cell that provided a maximum power density and open circuit voltage of 
      11.8±0.56µWcm(-2) and 0.17V, respectively.

AB  - Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved 
      lysosomal degradation pathway in all eukaryotic cells, which is critical for 
      maintaining cell homeostasis. A series of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins are 
      involved in the regulation of autophagy. The activities of ATG proteins are mainly 
      modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, 
      lipidation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. To tackle molecular 
      mechanisms of autophagy, more and more researches are focusing on the roles of PTMs 
      in regulation of the activity of ATG proteins and autophagy process. The protein 
      ligation techniques have emerged as powerful tools for the chemical engineering of 
      proteins with PTMs, and provided effective methods to elucidate the molecular 
      mechanism and physiological significance of PTMs. Recently, several ATG proteins 
      with PTM were prepared by protein ligation techniques such as native chemical 
      ligation (NCL), expressed protein ligation (EPL), peptide hydrazide-based NCL, and 
      Sortase A-mediated ligation (SML). More importantly, the synthesized ATG proteins 
      are successfully used to probe the mechanism of autophagy. In this review, we 
      summarize protein ligation techniques for the preparation of ATG proteins with PTMs. 
      In addition, we highlight the biological applications of synthetic ATG proteins to 
      probe the autophagy mechanism.

TI  - Inhibition of the Staphylococcus aureus sortase transpeptidase SrtA by phosphinic 
      peptidomimetics.
PG  - 3723-9
AB  - During pathogenesis, Gram-positive bacteria utilize surface protein virulence 
      factors such as the MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive 
      matrix molecules) to aid the initiation and propagation of infection through 
      adherence to host endothelial tissue and immune system evasion. These 
      virulence-associated proteins generally contain a C-terminal LPXTG motif that 
      becomes covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan biosynthesis intermediate lipid II. 
      In Staphylococcus aureus, deletion of the sortase isoform SrtA results in marked 
      reduction in virulence and infection potential, making it an important antivirulence 
      target. Here we describe the chemical synthesis and kinetic characterization of a 
      nonhydrolyzable phosphinic peptidomimetic inhibitor of SrtA derived from the LPXTG 
      substrate sequence.

TI  - Acacetin Protects Mice from Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infection by 
      Inhibiting the Activity of Sortase A.
LID - 1285
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major cause of infection in hospitals and 
      communities. Widespread dissemination of multi-drug resistant S. aureus is a serious 
      threat to the health of humans and animals. An anti-virulence strategy has been 
      widely considered as an alternative therapeutic approach. Inhibitors of virulence 
      factors are able to treat S. aureus infections without influencing the growth or 
      viability of bacteria and rarely lead to bacterial resistance. Sortase A (SrtA) is a 
      membrane-associated cysteine transpeptidase that catalyzes up to 25 surface proteins 
      that covalently bind to cell wall peptidoglycans. In S. aureus, most of these 
      surface proteins have been identified as important virulence factors that are vital 
      in bacterial pathogenesis. In the present study, we show that acacetin, a natural 
      flavonoid compound, inhibits the activity of SrtA in S. aureus (IC(50) = 36.46 ± 
      4.69 μg/mL, 128 μM) which affects the assembly of protein A (SpA) to cell walls and 
      reduces the binding of S. aureus to fibrinogen (Fg). The mechanism of the 
      interaction between acacetin and SrtA were preliminarily discussed using molecular 
      dynamics simulations. The results suggested that acacetin adopted a compact 
      conformation binding at the pocket of the SrtA via residues Arg-139 and Lys-140. By 
      performing an animal infection model, we demonstrated that acacetin was able to 
      protect mice from renal abscess formation induced by S. aureus and significantly 
      increased survival rates. Taken together, these findings suggest that acacetin may 
      be a promising candidate for the development of anti-S. aureus drugs.

AB  - Conjugation of functional molecules to peptides is necessary for protein analysis 
      and applications. Transpeptidase sortase A catalyzes the ligation reaction between 
      the amino acid sequence LPXTG and polyglycine and allows for peptide 
      sequence-specific molecular modifications. In this study, the preparation of 
      pentaglycine-fused green fluorescent protein (G5-GFP) via methionine truncation 
      mediated by Escherichia coli endogenous methionyl aminopeptidase was investigated. 
      Some expression vectors of GFP presenting MetGly5 at the N-terminal were 
      constructed, and N-terminal sequence analyses of the protein expressed in E. coli 
      were performed. When the first codon of the GFP-encoding sequence was AUG, a mixture 
      of GFP without pentaglycine and G5-GFP was obtained. In contrast, when the first 
      codon AUG was replaced with a codon encoding alanine, G5-GFP was obtained uniformly. 
      These results showed that the location of AUG in the expression vector had a 
      significant influence on the preparation of polyglycine-fused proteins. The obtained 
      findings are useful for the preparation of polyglycine-fused substrates using E. 
      coli.

PG  - 2719-2725
LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2020.11.011 [doi]
AB  - Insulin derivatives such as insulin detemir and insulin degludec are U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA)-approved long-acting insulin currently used by millions of 
      people with diabetes. These derivatives are modified in C-terminal B29 lysine to 
      retain insulin bioactivity. New and efficient methods for facile synthesis of 
      insulin derivatives may lead to new discovery of therapeutic insulin. Herein, we 
      report a new method using sortase A (SrtA)-mediated ligation for the synthesis of 
      insulin derivatives with high efficiency and functional group tolerance in the 
      C-terminal B chain. This new insulin molecule (Ins-SA) with an SrtA-recognizing 
      motif can be conjugated to diverse groups with N-terminal oligoglycines to generate 
      new insulin derivatives. We further demonstrated that a new insulin derivative 
      synthesized by this SrtA-mediated ligation shows strong cellular and in vivo 
      bioactivity. This enzymatic method can therefore be used for future insulin design 
      and development.

TI  - Sortase-mediated ligation of PsaE-modified photosystem I from Synechocystis sp. PCC 
      6803 to a conductive surface for enhanced photocurrent production on a gold 
      electrode.
PG  - 1180-8
LID - 10.1021/la5031284 [doi]
AB  - Sortase-mediated ligation was used to attach the photosystem I (PSI) complex from 
      Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in a preferential orientation to enhance photoinduced 
      electron flow to a conductive gold surface. Ideally, this method can result in a 
      uniform monolayer of protein, covalently bound unidirectionally to the electrode 
      surface. The exposed C-termini of the psaE subunits of the PSI trimer were targeted 
      to contain an LPETG-sortase recognition sequence to increase noncompeting electron 
      transfer by uniformly orienting the PSI stromal side proximal to the surface. 
      Surface characterization with atomic force microscopy suggested that monolayer 
      formation and optimal surface coverage occurred when the gold surfaces were 
      incubated with peptide at 100 to 500 μM concentrations. When photochronoamperometry 
      with potassium ferrocyanide and ferricyanide as redox mediators was used, 
      photocurrents in the range of 100 to 200 nA/cm(2) were produced, which is an 
      improvement over other attachment techniques for photosystem monolayers that produce 
      approximately 100 nA/cm(2) or less. This work demonstrated that sortase-mediated 
      ligation aided in the control of PSI orientation on modified gold surfaces with a 
      distribution of 94% stromal side proximal and 6% lumenal side proximal to the 
      surface for current-producing PSI.

      Streptococcus criceti in Streptococcus mutans strain GS-5 with mutations in both 
      gbpC and spaP genes.
PG  - 41-50
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, a cariogenic agent, has a glucan-binding protein gene, gbpC, 
      and S. criceti possesses four gbpC homologs, including dblA and dblB, as does S. 
      sobrinus. The S. criceti dblB gene encodes a 1,717-amino-acid protein having two 
      repetitive alanine-rich and proline-rich regions and an LPXTG motif, which is 
      recognized by the sortase SrtA, near the C terminus. Reverse transcription-PCR 
      analysis indicated no cotranscription of the dblA and dblB genes of S. criceti. As 
      we could not obtain a dblB mutant of S. criceti, the dblB gene was characterized in 
      S. mutans strain GS-5, which has genetic mutations in both gbpC and spaP genes and 
      shows an inability to agglutinate triggered by dextran. A dextran-induced 
      agglutination assay showed that S. mutans cells carrying dblB agglutinated in the 
      presence of dextran. A hydrophobicity assay showed that the cells containing dblB 
      were hydrophobic. A biofilm formation assay showed that the dblB gene was associated 
      with biofilm formation by cells cultivated in brain heart infusion broth 
      supplemented with glucose and maltose, but not sucrose. Nucleotide sequence analysis 
      of the S. criceti strains studied revealed a frameshift mutation in the srtA gene 
      encoding sortase, but intact dblA and dblB genes were found in dextran-induced 
      agglutination-negative strains, whereas intact dblA, dblB and srtA genes were found 
      in dextran-induced agglutination-positive strains. These results suggest the 
      cell-surface localization of dblA and dblB gene products by SrtA and the 
      responsibility of dblB for dextran-induced agglutination, cell-surface 
      hydrophobicity and biofilm formation in S. criceti.

TI  - Examine the characterization of biofilm formation and inhibition by targeting SrtA 
      mechanism in Bacillus subtilis: a combined experimental and theoretical study.
PG  - 2364

AB  - Bacillus subtilis is one of the well-known biofilm-forming organisms associated with 
      plants, animals, and also used as a model organism for all Bacillus sp. In B. 
      subtilis, SrtA enzyme plays the imperative roles in mechanism of signaling pathway 
      and microbial adherence toward the host. SrtA is highly considered as a universal 
      drug target for all Gram positive pathogens. Because of unresolved 3D structure of 
      SrtA in Gram positive bacteria including B. subtilis, we developed a homology model 
      protein using structural alignments of similar SrtA from B. anthracis. While the 
      structural model of SrtA is analyzed because of its significance in biofilm 
      formation by screening the suitable active site based compounds and analyzing the 
      ability of bacterial biofilm inhibition. Druggability site based screening able to 
      retrieve the active compounds against SrtA and checked the activity of the screened 
      compounds through experimental biochemical assays and in situ microscopic analysis. 
      Here in this study we concluded the computationally screened SrtA inhibitors showed 
      high level of biofilm inhibition despite difficulties in bacterial membrane 
      rigidification. Hence this study leads a way to the new compounds that may be useful 
      to treat the bacterial infections.

      protease expression in Chlamydia trachomatis infection.
PG  - 343-52
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201200701 [doi]
AB  - Protein ubiquitylation controls many cellular pathways, and timely removal of 
      ubiquitin by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) is essential to govern these different 
      functions. To map endogenous expression of individual DUBs as well as that of any 
      interacting proteins, we developed a catch-and-release ubiquitin probe. Ubiquitin 
      was equipped with an activity-based warhead and a cleavable linker attached to a 
      biotin affinity-handle through tandem site-specific modification, in which we 
      combined intein chemistry with sortase-mediated ligation. The resulting probe is 
      cell-impermeable and was therefore delivered to the cytosol of perfringolysin O 
      (PFO)-permeabilized cells. This allowed us to retrieve and identify 34 DUBs and 
      their interacting partners. We also noted the expression, in host cells infected 
      with Chlamydia trachomatis, of two additional DUBs. Furthermore, we retrieved and 
      identified chlamydial DUB1 (ChlaDUB1) and DUB2 (ChlaDUB2), demonstrating by 
      experiment that ChlaDUB2, the presence and activity of which had not been detected 
      in infected cells, is in fact expressed during the course of infection.

TI  - M13 bacteriophage display framework that allows sortase-mediated modification of 
      surface-accessible phage proteins.
PG  - 1478-87
LID - 10.1021/bc300130z [doi]
AB  - We exploit bacterial sortases to attach a variety of moieties to the capsid proteins 
      of M13 bacteriophage. We show that pIII, pIX, and pVIII can be functionalized with 
      entities ranging from small molecules (e.g., fluorophores, biotin) to correctly 
      folded proteins (e.g., GFP, antibodies, streptavidin) in a site-specific manner, and 
      with yields that surpass those of any reported using phage display technology. A 
      case in point is modification of pVIII. While a phage vector limits the size of the 
      insert into pVIII to a few amino acids, a phagemid system limits the number of 
      copies actually displayed at the surface of M13. Using sortase-based reactions, a 
      100-fold increase in the efficiency of display of GFP onto pVIII is achieved. Taking 
      advantage of orthogonal sortases, we can simultaneously target two distinct capsid 
      proteins in the same phage particle and maintain excellent specificity of labeling. 
      As demonstrated in this work, this is a simple and effective method for creating a 
      variety of structures, thus expanding the use of M13 for materials science 
      applications and as a biological tool.

TI  - Corynebacterium diphtheriae employs specific minor pilins to target human pharyngeal 
      epithelial cells.
PG  - 111-24
AB  - Adherence to host tissues mediated by pili is pivotal in the establishment of 
      infection by many bacterial pathogens. Corynebacterium diphtheriae assembles on its 
      surface three distinct pilus structures. The function and the mechanism of how 
      various pili mediate adherence, however, have remained poorly understood. Here we 
      show that the SpaA-type pilus is sufficient for the specific adherence of 
      corynebacteria to human pharyngeal epithelial cells. The deletion of the spaA gene, 
      which encodes the major pilin forming the pilus shaft, abolishes pilus assembly but 
      not adherence to pharyngeal cells. In contrast, adherence is greatly diminished when 
      either minor pilin SpaB or SpaC is absent. Antibodies directed against either SpaB 
      or SpaC block bacterial adherence. Consistent with a direct role of the minor 
      pilins, latex beads coated with SpaB or SpaC protein bind specifically to pharyngeal 
      cells. Therefore, tissue tropism of corynebacteria for pharyngeal cells is governed 
      by specific minor pilins. Importantly, immunoelectron microscopy and 
      immunofluorescence studies reveal clusters of minor pilins that are anchored to cell 
      surface in the absence of a pilus shaft. Thus, the minor pilins may also be cell 
      wall anchored in addition to their incorporation into pilus structures that could 
      facilitate tight binding to host cells during bacterial infection.

TI  - The atypical amino-terminal LPNTG-containing domain of the pneumococcal human 
      IgA1-specific protease is required for proper enzyme localization and function.
PG  - 526-43
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae produces a zinc metalloproteinase, Iga, which cleaves human 
      immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), and whose activity is predominantly localized to the 
      bacterial surface. However, proper surface localization is not predicted using 
      current models, as the LPNTG sorting motif is located atypically near the amino- 
      rather than the carboxy-terminus. The cell-associated form of Iga was confirmed to 
      be external to the bacterial membrane, and while bound tightly, its attachment to 
      the cell wall is non-covalent, but dependent on both a complete LPNTG sequence and 
      sortase activity. Disruption of the region between the signal peptidase cleavage 
      site and the LPNTG domain resulted in a localization defect, premature degradation, 
      and an alteration of the ability of the enzyme to act on a monoclonal human IgA1 
      substrate and to enhance bacterial adherence, linking localization to enzyme 
      function. Edman sequencing of cell-associated Iga determined that the enzyme is 
      processed at an unexpected site downstream of the sorting signal yet still 
      associates with the bacterial surface. Our results indicate a non-covalent 
      re-association between the carboxy-terminal enzymatic domain and the cleaved, sorted 
      amino-terminal localization domain. This amino-terminal motif is shared among the 
      other zinc metalloproteinases in streptococci and suggests a novel conserved 
      mechanism for the surface localization of protease activity.

TI  - A comparative genome analysis identifies distinct sorting pathways in gram-positive 
      bacteria.
PG  - 2710-22
AB  - Surface proteins in gram-positive bacteria are frequently required for virulence, 
      and many are attached to the cell wall by sortase enzymes. Bacteria frequently 
      encode more than one sortase enzyme and an even larger number of potential sortase 
      substrates that possess an LPXTG-type cell wall sorting signal. In order to 
      elucidate the sorting pathways present in gram-positive bacteria, we performed a 
      comparative analysis of 72 sequenced microbial genomes. We show that sortase enzymes 
      can be partitioned into five distinct subfamilies based upon their primary sequences 
      and that most of their substrates can be predicted by making a few conservative 
      assumptions. Most bacteria encode sortases from two or more subfamilies, which are 
      predicted to function nonredundantly in sorting proteins to the cell surface. Only 
      approximately 20% of sortase-related proteins are most closely related to the 
      well-characterized Staphylococcus aureus SrtA protein, but nonetheless, these 
      proteins are responsible for anchoring the majority of surface proteins in 
      gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, most sortase-like proteins are predicted to 
      play a more specialized role, with each anchoring far fewer proteins that contain 
      unusual sequence motifs. The functional sortase-substrate linkage predictions are 
      available online (http://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/Services/Sortase/) in a searchable 
      database.

TI  - Differential recognition of surface proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes by two 
      sortase gene homologs.
PG  - 2181-91
AB  - The interaction of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) with its 
      human host requires several surface proteins. In this study, we isolated mutations 
      in a gene required for the surface localization of protein F by transposon 
      mutagenesis of the M6 strain JRS4. This gene (srtA) encodes a protein homologous to 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase, which covalently links proteins containing an LPXTG 
      motif to the cell wall. The GAS srtA mutant was defective in anchoring the 
      LPXTG-containing proteins M6, protein F, ScpA, and GRAB to the cell surface. This 
      phenotype was complemented when a wild-type srtA gene was provided in trans. The 
      surface localization of T6, however, was unaffected by the srtA mutation. The M1 
      genome sequence contains a second open reading frame with a motif characteristic of 
      sortase proteins. Inactivation of this gene (designated srtB) in strain JRS4 
      affected the surface localization of T6 but not M6, protein F, ScpA, or GRAB. This 
      phenotype was complemented by srtB in trans. An srtA probe hybridized with DNA from 
      all GAS strains tested (M types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 22, and 50 and nontypeable strain 
      64/14) and from streptococcal groups C and G, while srtB hybridized with DNA from 
      only a few GAS strains. We conclude that srtA and srtB encode sortase enzymes 
      required for anchoring different subsets of proteins to the cell wall. It seems 
      likely that the multiple sortase homologs in the genomes of other gram-positive 
      bacteria have a similar substrate-specific role.

AB  - We have developed a method for Enzymatic Sortase-assisted Covalent 
      Orientation-specific Restraint Tethering (ESCORT) recombinant proteins onto surfaces 
      directly from cell-lysate. With an improved surface passivation method, we obviate 
      the cumbersome purification steps even for single molecule studies that demand high 
      purity in the sample. We demonstrated high-specificity of the method, high-passivity 
      of the surface and uncompromised functional integrity of anchored proteins using 
      single molecule fluorescence and force-mapping. We anticipate that this method will 
      substantially reduce the investment by way of time, money and energy in the area of 
      single molecule studies.

TI  - Effect of srtA and srtB gene expression on the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus in 
      animal models of infection.
PG  - 480-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role that the surface proteins anchored by the srtA and srtB gene 
      products play in the ability of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria to establish 
      infection was investigated in several animal models. METHODS: Wild-type and 
      corresponding mutants with deletions of the srtA and/or srtB genes were used in 
      murine acute lethal infection, septic arthritis, kidney infection and rat 
      endocarditis models. RESULTS: The LD(50) of the wild-type and srtB- knockout were 
      comparable and approximately two- to four-fold lower than the required inoculum of 
      the srtA- and srtA-B- strains. This difference was exhibited as a two-fold greater 
      mortality at the highest inoculum. The wild-type strain established arthritic 
      inflammation in over 90% of the animals with a maximum arthritic index of 6.5 by 
      days 17-21. The srtB- knockout was able to cause inflammation in 70-80% of the mice, 
      but with a lower index of 3.0. Both the srtA- and srtA-B- strains appeared to be 
      less virulent in this model with arthritic indices of around 0.5 and only 20% of the 
      animals with inflammation. Strains with the srtA mutation achieved statistically 
      significant lower titres than wild-type in kidneys of mice after intravenous 
      infection. Mean bacterial counts in cardiac vegetations were significantly higher 
      for the wild-type and srtB- strain compared with the srtA- and srtA-B- strains. 
      CONCLUSION: Results from this study substantiate the role of the srtA gene product 
      in the establishment of infections and further studies are warranted to define and 
      exploit this as a target for antimicrobial chemotherapy.

AB  - A major challenge in attaching fluorophores or other handles to proteins is the 
      availability of a site-specific labeling strategy that provides stoichiometric 
      modification without compromising protein integrity. We developed a simple approach 
      that combines TEV protease cleavage, sortase modification and affinity purification 
      to N-terminally label proteins. To achieve stoichiometrically-labeled protein, we 
      included a short affinity tag in the fluorophore-containing peptide for 
      post-labeling purification of the modified protein. This strategy can be easily 
      applied to any recombinant protein with a TEV site and we demonstrate this on 
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Membrane Scaffold Protein (MSP) 
      constructs.

AB  - Sortase is a cysteine-transpeptidase that anchors LPXTG-containing proteins on the 
      Gram-positive bacterial cell wall. Previously, sortase was considered to be an 
      important factor for bacterial pathogenesis and fitness, but not cell growth. 
      However, the Actinomyces oris sortase is essential for cell viability, due to its 
      coupling to a glycosylation pathway. In this chapter, we describe the methods to

TI  - Structural elucidation of SrtA enzyme in Enterococcus faecalis: an emphasis on 
      screening of potential inhibitors against the biofilm formation.
PG  - 1775-89
LID - 10.1039/c3mb70613c [doi]
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium, which mainly infects 
      humans through urinary tract infections. SrtA is an essential enzyme for survival of 
      E. faecalis, and inhibition of this particular enzyme will reduce the virulence of 
      biofilm formation. It is proved to be associated with the microbial surface protein 
      embedded signal transduction mechanism and promising as a suitable anti-microbial 
      drug target for E. faecalis. The present work gives an inclusive description of SrtA 
      isolated from E. faecalis through computational and experimental methodologies. For 
      exploring the mechanism of SrtA and to screen potential leads against E. faecalis, 
      we have generated three-dimensional models through homology modeling. The 3D model 
      showed conformational stability over time, confirming the quality of the starting 3D 
      model. Large scale 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations show the intramolecular 
      changes occurring in SrtA, and multiple conformations of structure based screening 
      elucidate potential leads against this pathogen. Experimental results showed that 
      the screened compounds are active showing anti-microbial and anti-biofilm activity, 
      as SrtA is known to play an important role in E. faecalis biofilm formation. 
      Experimental results also suggest that SrtA specific screened compounds have better 
      anti-biofilm activity than the available inhibitors. Therefore, we believe that 
      development of these compounds would be an impetus to design the novel chief SrtA 
      inhibitors against E. faecalis.

TI  - Functional analysis of the Lactobacillus casei BL23 sortases.
PG  - 8684-93
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02287-12 [doi]
AB  - Sortases are a class of enzymes that anchor surface proteins to the cell wall of 
      Gram-positive bacteria. Lactobacillus casei BL23 harbors four sortase genes, two 
      belonging to class A (srtA1 and srtA2) and two belonging to class C (srtC1 and 
      srtC2). Class C sortases were clustered with genes encoding their putative 
      substrates that were homologous to the SpaEFG and SpaCBA proteins that encode mucus 
      adhesive pili in Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Twenty-three genes encoding putative 
      sortase substrates were identified in the L. casei BL23 genome with unknown (35%), 
      enzymatic (30%), or adhesion-related (35%) functions. Strains disrupted in srtA1, 
      srtA2, srtC1, and srtC2 and an srtA1 srtA2 double mutant were constructed. The 
      transcription of all four sortase encoding genes was detected, but only the mutation 
      of srtA1 resulted in a decrease in bacterial surface hydrophobicity. The 
      β-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and cell wall proteinase activities of whole cells 
      diminished in the srtA1 mutant and, to a greater extent, in the srtA1 srtA2 double 
      mutant. Cell wall anchoring of the staphylococcal NucA reporter protein fused to a 
      cell wall sorting sequence was also affected in the srtA mutants, and the 
      percentages of adhesion to Caco-2 and HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells were reduced 
      for the srtA1 srtA2 strain. Mutations in srtC1 or srtC2 result in an undetectable 
      phenotype. Together, these results suggest that SrtA1 is the housekeeping sortase in 
      L. casei BL23 and SrtA2 would carry out redundant or complementary functions that 
      become evident when SrtA1 activity is absent.

PG  - e9216
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0009216 [doi]
LID - e9216
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is the primary colonizer of the anogenital mucosa of up to 
      30% of healthy women and can infect newborns during delivery and cause severe sepsis 
      and meningitis. Persistent colonization usually involves the formation of biofilm 
      and increasing evidences indicate that in pathogenic streptococci biofilm formation 
      is mediated by pili. Recently, we have characterized pili distribution and 
      conservation in 289 GBS clinical isolates and we have shown that GBS has three pilus 
      types, 1, 2a and 2b encoded by three corresponding pilus islands, and that each 
      strain carries one or two islands. Here we have investigated the capacity of these 
      strains to form biofilms. We have found that most of the biofilm-formers carry pilus 
      2a, and using insertion and deletion mutants we have confirmed that pilus type 2a, 
      but not pilus types 1 and 2b, confers biofilm-forming phenotype. We also show that 
      deletion of the major ancillary protein of type 2a did not impair biofilm formation 
      while the inactivation of the other ancillary protein and of the backbone protein 
      completely abolished this phenotype. Furthermore, antibodies raised against pilus 
      components inhibited bacterial adherence to solid surfaces, offering new strategies 
      to prevent GBS infection by targeting bacteria during their initial attachment to 
      host epithelial cells.

PG  - 224-30
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-302X.2008.00499.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus sobrinus exhibits more significant dextran-dependent 
      aggregation mediated by glucan-binding proteins than Streptococcus mutans. We have 
      identified four glucan-binding protein C gene (gbpC) homologues designated as gbpC1, 
      gbpC2, dblA and dblB in S. sobrinus in contrast to the single gene gbpC in S. 
      mutans. We attempted to determine which gene is most responsible for the 
      dextran-dependent aggregation of S. sobrinus. METHODS: We introduced mutation with a 
      chemical mutagen, 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine, into S. sobrinus strain 6715 
      and analysed the four gbpC homologous gene sequences in the parental strain 6715 and 
      an obtained aggregation-negative mutant NUM-Ssg99. We also examined the localization 
      of proteins encoded by these genes in the mutant NUM-Ssg99. RESULTS: The nucleotide 
      sequences of the gbpC1, gbpC2 and dblA genes in NUM-Ssg99 were 100% identical to the 
      homologous genes in parental strain 6715. In contrast, a truncated mutation was 
      detected in the dblB gene and the mutant protein devoid of the LPXTG motif was 
      confirmed by Western blot analysis to be released into the extracellular milieu. 
      CONCLUSION: We conclude that the dblB gene among the four GbpC homologous protein 
      genes is most responsible for aggregation in strain 6715.

TI  - Bacillus subtilis YhcR, a high-molecular-weight, nonspecific endonuclease with a 
      unique domain structure.
PG  - 5376-83
AB  - In a continuing effort to identify ribonucleases that may be involved in mRNA decay 
      in Bacillus subtilis, fractionation of a protein extract from a triple-mutant strain 
      that was missing three previously characterized 3'-to-5' exoribonucleases 
      (polynucleotide phosphorylase [PNPase], RNase R, and YhaM) was undertaken. These 
      experiments revealed the presence of a high-molecular-weight nuclease encoded by the 
      yhcR gene that was active in the presence of Ca(2+) and Mn(2+). YhcR is a 
      sugar-nonspecific nuclease that cleaves endonucleolytically to yield nucleotide 
      3'-monophosphate products, similar to the well-characterized micrococcal nuclease of 
      Staphylococcus aureus. YhcR appears to be located principally in the cell wall and 
      is likely to be a substrate for a B. subtilis sortase. Zymogram analysis suggests 
      that YhcR is the major Ca(2+)-activated nuclease of B. subtilis. In addition to 
      having a unique overall domain structure, YhcR contains a hitherto unknown 
      structural domain that we have named "NYD," for "new YhcR domain."

TI  - Sortase from Staphylococcus aureus does not contain a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair 
      in its active site.
PG  - 34061-5
AB  - Many surface proteins are anchored to the cell wall by the action of sortase 
      enzymes, a recently discovered family of cysteine transpeptidases. As the surface 
      proteins of human pathogens are frequently required for virulence, the 
      sortase-mediated anchoring reaction represents a potential target for new 
      anti-infective agents. It has been suggested that the sortase from Staphylococcus 
      aureus (SrtA), may use a similar catalytic strategy as the papain cysteine 
      proteases, holding its Cys184 side chain in an active configuration through a 
      thiolate-imidazolium ion interaction with residue His120. To investigate the 
      mechanism of transpeptidation, we have synthesized a peptidyl-vinyl sulfone 
      substrate mimic that irreversibly inhibits SrtA. Through the study of the pH 
      dependence of SrtA inhibition and NMR, we have estimated the pKas of the active site 
      thiol (Cys184) and imidazole (His120) to be approximately 9.4 and 7.0, respectively. 
      These measurements are inconsistent with the existence of a thiolate-imidazolium ion 
      pair and suggest a general base catalysis mechanism during transpeptidation.

TI  - Structure of sortase, the transpeptidase that anchors proteins to the cell wall of 
      Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 6056-61
AB  - Surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria play important roles during the 
      pathogenesis of human infections and require sortase for anchoring to the cell-wall 
      envelope. Sortase cleaves surface proteins at the LPXTG motif and catalyzes the 
      formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl group of threonine (T) and the amino 
      group of cell-wall crossbridges. The NMR structure of sortase reveals a unique 
      beta-barrel structure, in which the active-site sulfhydryl of cysteine-184 is poised 
      for ionization by histidine-120, presumably enabling the resultant thiolate to 
      attack the LPXTG peptide. Calcium binding near the active site stimulates catalysis, 
      possibly by altering the conformation of a surface loop that recognizes newly 
      translocated polypeptides. The structure suggests a mechanistic relationship to the 
      papain/cathepsin proteases and should facilitate the design of new antiinfective 
      agents.

TI  - Purification and characterization of sortase, the transpeptidase that cleaves 
      surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus at the LPXTG motif.
PG  - 12424-9
AB  - Surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus are linked to the bacterial cell wall by 
      sortase, an enzyme that cleaves polypeptides at the threonine of the LPXTG motif. 
      Surface proteins can be released from staphylococci by treatment with hydroxylamine, 
      resulting in the formation of threonine hydroxamate. Staphylococcal extracts, as 
      well as purified sortase, catalyze the hydroxylaminolysis of peptides bearing an 
      LPXTG motif, a reaction that can be inhibited with sulfhydryl-modifying reagents. 
      Replacement of the single conserved cysteine at position 184 of sortase with alanine 
      abolishes enzyme activity. Thus, sortase appears to catalyze surface-protein 
      anchoring by means of a transpeptidation reaction that captures cleaved polypeptides 
      as thioester enzyme intermediates.

TI  - Role of SrtA in Pathogenicity of Staphylococcus lugdunensis.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8121975 [doi]
LID - 1975
AB  - Among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Staphylococcus lugdunensis has a 
      special position as causative agent of aggressive courses of infectious endocarditis 
      (IE) more reminiscent of IEs caused by Staphylococcus aureus than those by CoNS. To 
      initiate colonization and invasion, bacterial cell surface proteins are required; 
      however, only little is known about adhesion of S. lugdunensis to biotic surfaces. 
      Cell surface proteins containing the LPXTG anchor motif are covalently attached to 
      the cell wall by sortases. Here, we report the functionality of Staphylococcus 
      lugdunensis sortase A (SrtA) to link LPXTG substrates to the cell wall. To determine 
      the role of SrtA dependent surface proteins in biofilm formation and binding 
      eukaryotic cells, we generated SrtA-deficient mutants (ΔsrtA). These mutants formed 
      a smaller amount of biofilm and bound less to immobilized fibronectin, fibrinogen, 
      and vitronectin. Furthermore, SrtA absence affected the gene expression of two 
      different adhesins on transcription level. Surprisingly, we found no decreased 
      adherence and invasion in human cell lines, probably caused by the upregulation of 
      further adhesins in ΔsrtA mutant strains. In conclusion, the functionality of S. 
      lugdunensis SrtA in anchoring LPXTG substrates to the cell wall let us define it as 
      the pathogen's housekeeping sortase.

TI  - Characterization of the housekeeping sortase from the human pathogen 
      Propionibacterium acnes: first investigation of a class F sortase.
PG  - 665-682
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20180885 [doi]
AB  - Sortase enzymes play an important role in Gram-positive bacteria. They are 
      responsible for the covalent attachment of proteins to the surface of the bacteria 
      and perform this task via a highly sequence-specific transpeptidation reaction. 
      Since these immobilized proteins are often involved in pathogenicity of 
      Gram-positive bacteria, characterization of this type of enzyme is also of medical 
      relevance. Different classes of sortases (A-F) have been found, which recognize 
      characteristic recognition sequences present in substrate proteins. Up to date, 
      sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus, a housekeeping class A sortase, is the most 
      thoroughly studied representative of the sortase family of enzymes. Here we report 
      the in-depth characterization of the class F sortase from Propionibacterium acnes, a 
      class of sortases that has not been investigated before. As Sortase F is the only 
      transpeptidase found in the P. acnes genome, it is the housekeeping sortase of this 
      organism. Sortase F from P. acnes shows a behavior similar to sortases from class A 
      in terms of pH dependence, recognition sequence and catalytic activity; furthermore, 
      its activity is independent of bivalent ions, which contrasts to sortase A from S. 
      aureus We demonstrate that sortase F is useful for protein engineering applications, 
      by producing a site-specifically conjugated homogenous antibody-drug conjugate with 
      a potency similar to that of a conjugate prepared with sortase A. Thus, the detailed 
      characterization presented here will not only enable the development of 
      anti-virulence agents targeting P. acnes but also provides a powerful alternative to 
      sortase A for protein engineering applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To overcome laborious and costly procedures often associated with 
      therapeutic protein production and purification, in vivo polyester immobilized 
      sortase is explored for the production of human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) 
      and human interferon alpha 2b (IFNα2b) by Escherichia coli. RESULTS: Hybrid genes 
      encoding PhaC-Sortase-TNFα or PhaC-Sortase-IFNα2b fusions (with a LPETG recognition 
      signal immediately before TNFα or IFNα2b), mediated intracellular production of 
      polyester (polyhydroxyalkanoate, PHA) beads in Escherichia coli. Upon isolation of 
      respective PHA beads, pure soluble TNFα or IFNα2b was released by activating sortase 
      via addition of CaCl(2) and triglycine. TNFα and IFNα2b each were recognized by 
      corresponding conformational antibodies in an ELISA assay. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo 
      polyester immobilized sortase could be exploited for production and purification of 
      high-value therapeutic proteins without laborious and costly downstream processing.

TI  - Subunit-Specific Labeling of Ubiquitin Chains by Using Sortase: Insights into the 
      Selectivity of Deubiquitinases.
PG  - 1525-31
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201600276 [doi]
AB  - Information embedded in different ubiquitin chains is transduced by proteins with 
      ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) and erased by a set of hydrolytic enzymes referred 
      to as deubiquitinases (DUBs). Understanding the selectivity of UBDs and DUBs is 
      necessary for decoding the functions of different ubiquitin chains. Critical to 
      these efforts is the access to chemically defined ubiquitin chains bearing 
      site-specific fluorescent labels. One approach toward constructing such molecules 
      involves peptide ligation by sortase (SrtA), a bacterial transpeptidase responsible 
      for covalently attaching cell surface proteins to the cell wall. Here, we 
      demonstrate the utility of SrtA in modifying individual subunits of ubiquitin 
      chains. Using ubiquitin derivatives in which an N-terminal glycine is unveiled after 
      protease-mediated digestion, we synthesized ubiquitin dimers, trimers, and tetramers 
      with different isopeptide linkages. SrtA was then used in combination with 
      fluorescent depsipeptide substrates to effect the modification of each subunit in a 
      chain. By constructing branched ubiquitin chains with individual subunits tagged 
      with a fluorophore, we provide evidence that the ubiquitin-specific protease USP15 
      prefers ubiquitin trimers but has little preference for a particular isopeptide 
      linkage. Our results emphasize the importance of subunit-specific labeling of 
      ubiquitin chains when studying how DUBs process these chains.

TI  - Anchoring of LPXTG-Like Proteins to the Gram-Positive Cell Wall Envelope.
PG  - 159-175
LID - 10.1007/82_2016_8 [doi]
AB  - In Gram-positive bacteria, protein precursors with a signal peptide and a cell wall 
      sorting signal (CWSS)-which begins with an LPXTG motif, followed by a hydrophobic 
      domain and a tail of positively charged residues-are targeted to the cell envelope 
      by a transpeptidase enzyme call sortase. Evolution and selective pressure gave rise 
      to six classes of sortase, i.e., SrtA-F. Only class C sortases are capable of 
      polymerizing substrates harboring the pilin motif and CWSS into protein polymers 
      known as pili or fimbriae, whereas the others perform cell wall anchoring functions. 
      Regardless of the products generated from these sortases, the basic principle of 
      sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation is the same. It begins with the cleavage of the 
      LPXTG motif, followed by the cross-linking of this cleaved product at the threonine 
      residue to a nucleophile, i.e., an active amino group of the peptidoglycan stem 
      peptide or the lysine residue of the pilin motif. This chapter will summarize the 
      efforts to identify and characterize sortases and their associated pathways with 
      emphasis on the cell wall anchoring function.

TI  - The structure of the Staphylococcus aureus sortase-substrate complex reveals how the 
      universally conserved LPXTG sorting signal is recognized.
PG  - 24465-77
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.022624 [doi]
AB  - In Gram-positive bacteria, sortase enzymes assemble surface proteins and pili in the 
      cell wall envelope. Sortases catalyze a transpeptidation reaction that joins a 
      highly conserved LPXTG sorting signal within their polypeptide substrate to the cell 
      wall or to other pilin subunits. The molecular basis of transpeptidation and sorting 
      signal recognition are not well understood, because the intermediates of catalysis 
      are short lived. We have overcome this problem by synthesizing an analog of the 
      LPXTG signal whose stable covalent complex with the enzyme mimics a key thioacyl 
      catalytic intermediate. Here we report the solution structure and dynamics of its 
      covalent complex with the Staphylococcus aureus SrtA sortase. In marked contrast to 
      a previously reported crystal structure, we show that SrtA adaptively recognizes the 
      LPXTG sorting signal by closing and immobilizing an active site loop. We have also 
      used chemical shift mapping experiments to localize the binding site for the 
      triglycine portion of lipid II, the second substrate to which surface proteins are 
      attached. We propose a unified model of the transpeptidation reaction that explains 
      the functions of key active site residues. Since the sortase-catalyzed anchoring 
      reaction is required for the virulence of a number of bacterial pathogens, the 
      results presented here may facilitate the development of new anti-infective agents.

TI  - The SrtA Sortase of Streptococcus agalactiae is required for cell wall anchoring of 
      proteins containing the LPXTG motif, for adhesion to epithelial cells, and for 
      colonization of the mouse intestine.
PG  - 3342-50
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]) is the leading cause of 
      neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. An in silico genome analysis indicated 
      that GBS strain NEM316 encodes 35 proteins containing an LPXTG motif which are 
      thought to be covalently linked to the peptidoglycan by an enzyme called sortase. 
      The role of these cell wall-anchored proteins in GBS pathogenesis was evaluated on a 
      global level by inactivating the srtA gene. This gene encodes the major sortase SrtA 
      that anchors most of the LPXTG-containing proteins. We chose the C5a peptidase 
      (ScpB) and Alp2, an abundant immunogenic protein, as prototypical LPXTG-containing 
      proteins. As expected, the SrtA knockout mutant was unable to anchor the C5a 
      peptidase (ScpB) and Alp2 to the cell wall. Complementation with plasmid-borne srtA 
      inserted into the chromosome restored the correct surface localization of both ScpB 
      and Alp2. Interestingly, the SrtA mutant was impaired for binding to the major 
      extracellular matrix components fibronectin and fibrinogen and displayed a 
      significant reduction in adherence to human (A549, HeLa, and Caco-2) and murine (L2) 
      epithelial cells compared to the parental wild-type strain. Surprisingly, the 
      inactivation of srtA had no effect on the virulence of the type III strain of GBS in 
      a neonatal rat model (measured by the 50% lethal dose and lung colonization) but 
      strongly impaired the capacity of the strain to colonize the intestines of 
      gnotobiotic mice in a competition assay. These results demonstrate that 
      LPXTG-containing proteins are involved in cell adhesion and GBS persistence in vivo.

TI  - Inactivation of the srtA gene in Listeria monocytogenes inhibits anchoring of 
      surface proteins and affects virulence.
PG  - 869-81
AB  - During infection of their hosts, Gram-positive bacteria express surface proteins 
      that serve multiple biological functions. Surface proteins harbouring a C-terminal 
      sorting signal with an LPXTG motif are covalently linked to the cell wall 
      peptidoglycan by a transamidase named sortase. Two genes encoding putative sortases, 
      termed srtA and srtB, were identified in the genome of the intracellular pathogenic 
      bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Inactivation of srtA abolishes anchoring of the 
      invasion protein InlA to the bacterial surface. It also prevents the proper sorting 
      of several other peptidoglycan-associated LPXTG proteins. Three were identified by a 
      mass spectrometry approach. The DeltasrtA mutant strain is defective in entering 
      epithelial cells, similar to a DeltainlA mutant. In contrast to a DeltainlA mutant, 
      the DeltasrtA mutant is impaired for colonization of the liver and spleen after oral 
      inoculation in mice. Thus, L. monocytogenes srtA is required for the cell wall 
      anchoring of InlA and, presumably, for the anchoring of other LPXTG-containing 
      proteins that are involved in listerial infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In Streptococcus mutans, a Gram-positive pathogen of dental caries, 
      several surface proteins are anchored by the activity of sortase enzyme. Although 
      various reports have shown that constructed S. mutans mutants deficient of sortase 
      as well as laboratory reference strains with a sortase gene mutation have low 
      cariogenic potential, no known studies have investigated clinical isolates with 
      sortase defects. Here, we examined the cariogenic properties of S. mutans clinical 
      isolates with sortase defects as well as caries status in humans harboring such 
      defective isolates. DESIGN: Sortase-defective clinical isolates were evaluated for 
      biofilm formation, sucrose-dependent adhesion, stress-induced dextran-dependent 
      aggregation, acid production, and acid tolerance. Additionally, caries indices of 
      subjects possessing such defective isolates were determined. RESULTS: Our in vitro 
      results indicated that biofilm with a lower quantity was formed by sortase-defective 
      as compared to non-defective isolates. Moreover, impairments of sucrose-dependent 
      adhesion and stress-induced dextran-dependent aggregation were found among the 
      isolates with defects, whereas no alterations were seen in regard to acid production 
      or tolerance. Furthermore, glucan-binding protein C, a surface protein anchored by 
      sortase activity, was predominantly detected in culture supernatants of all 
      sortase-defective S. mutans isolates. Although the sortase-defective isolates showed 
      lower cariogenic potential because of a reduction in some cariogenic properties, 
      deft/DMFT indices revealed that all subjects harboring those isolates had caries 
      experience. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the impairment of cariogenic 
      properties in S. mutans clinical isolates with sortase defects, though the detection 
      of these defective isolates seemed not to imply low caries risk in the subjects 
      harboring them.

TI  - Cell surface display of minor pilin adhesins in the form of a simple heterodimeric 
      assembly in Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
PG  - 1236-47
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07515.x [doi]
AB  - Pilus assembly in Gram-positive bacteria occurs by a two-step mechanism, whereby 
      pilins are polymerized and then covalently anchored to the cell wall. In 
      Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the pilin-specific sortase SrtA catalyses 
      polymerization of the SpaA-type pilus, consisting of the shaft pilin SpaA, tip pilin 
      SpaC and minor pilin SpaB. Cell wall anchoring of the SpaA polymers is triggered 
      when SrtA incorporates SpaB into the pilus base via lysine-mediated 
      transpeptidation; anchoring to the cell wall peptidoglycan is subsequently catalysed 
      by the housekeeping sortase SrtF. Here we show that SpaB and SpaC formed a 
      heterodimer independent of SpaA polymerization. SrtA was absolutely required for the 
      formation of the SpaBC heterodimer, while SrtF facilitated the optimal cell wall 
      anchoring of this heterodimer. Alanine substitution of the SpaB lysine residue K139 
      or truncation of the SpaB cell wall-sorting signal (CWSS) abolished assembly of the 
      SpaBC heterodimer, hence underscoring SpaB function in transpeptidation and cell 
      wall linkage. Importantly, sortase specificity for the cell wall-anchoring step was 
      found to be dependent on the LAFTG motif within the SpaB CWSS. Thus, C. diphtheriae 
      employs a common sortase-catalysed mechanism involving lysine-mediated 
      transpeptidation to generate both adhesive pilus and simple heterodimeric structures 
      on the bacterial the cell wall.

AB  - Cell surface pili are polymeric protein assemblies that enable bacteria to adhere to 
      surfaces and to specific host tissues. The pili expressed by Gram-positive bacteria 
      constitute a unique paradigm in which sortase-mediated covalent linkages join 
      successive pilin subunits like beads on a string. These pili are formed from two or 
      three distinct types of pilin subunit, typically encoded in small gene clusters, 
      often with their cognate sortases. In Group A streptococci (GAS), a major pilin 
      forms the polymeric backbone, whereas two minor pilins are located at the tip and 
      the base. Here, we report the 1.9-A resolution crystal structure of the GAS basal 
      pilin FctB, revealing an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like N-terminal domain with an extended 
      proline-rich tail. Unexpected structural homology between the FctB Ig-like domain 
      and the N-terminal domain of the GAS shaft pilin helps explain the use of the same 
      sortase for polymerization of the shaft and its attachment to FctB. It also enabled 
      the identification, from mass spectral data, of the lysine residue involved in the 
      covalent linkage of FctB to the shaft. The proline-rich tail forms a polyproline-II 
      helix that appears to be a common feature of the basal (cell wall-anchoring) pilins. 
      Together, our results indicate distinct structural elements in the pilin proteins 
      that play a role in selecting for the appropriate sortases and thereby help 
      orchestrate the ordered assembly of the pilus.

      of a single polypeptide with different labels at its N and C termini. SrtA(strep) is 
      used to label the protein's C terminus at an LPXTG site with a fluorescently labeled 
      dialanine nucleophile. Selective N-terminal labeling of proteins containing 
      N-terminal glycine residues is achieved using SrtA(staph) and LPXT derivatives. The 
      generality of N-terminal labeling with SrtA(staph) is demonstrated by 
      near-quantitative labeling of multiple protein substrates with excellent site 
      specificity.

TI  - Comparative and functional analysis of sortase-dependent proteins in the predicted 
      secretome of Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118.
PG  - 4143-53
AB  - Surface proteins are important factors in the interaction of probiotic and 
      pathogenic bacteria with their environment or host. We performed a comparative 
      bioinformatic analysis of four publicly available Lactobacillus genomes and the 
      genome of Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius strain UCC118 to identify 
      secreted proteins and those linked to the cell wall. Proteins were identified which 
      were predicted to be anchored by WXL-binding domains, N- or C-terminal anchors, GW 
      repeats, lipoprotein anchors, or LysM-binding domains. We identified 10 
      sortase-dependent surface proteins in L. salivarius UCC118, including three which 
      are homologous to mucus-binding proteins (LSL_0152, LSL_0311, and LSL_1335), a 
      collagen-binding protein homologue (LSL_2020b), two hypothetical proteins (LSL_1838 
      and LSL_1902b), an enterococcal surface protein homologue (LSL_1085), a salivary 
      agglutinin-binding homologue (LSL_1832b), an epithelial binding protein homologue 
      (LSL_1319), and a proteinase homologue (LSL_1774b). However, two of the genes are 
      gene fragments and four are pseudogenes, suggesting a lack of selection for their 
      function. Two of the 10 genes were not transcribed in vitro, and 1 gene showed a 
      10-fold increase in transcript level in stationary phase compared to logarithmic 
      phase. The sortase gene was deleted, and three genes encoding sortase-dependent 
      proteins were disrupted. The sortase mutant and one sortase-dependent protein 
      (mucus-binding homologue) mutant showed a significant reduction in adherence to 
      human epithelial cell lines. The genome-wide investigation of surface proteins can 
      thus help our understanding of their roles in host interaction.

TI  - Purification and characterization of streptin, a type A1 lantibiotic produced by 
      Streptococcus pyogenes.
PG  - 2737-47
AB  - Approximately 10% of Streptococcus pyogenes strains inhibit the growth of all nine 
      indicators in a standardized streptococcal bacteriocin typing scheme. The present 
      study has shown that this inhibitory profile, referred to as bacteriocin producer 
      (P)-type 777 activity, is due to the type A1 lantibiotic streptin. Two major forms 
      of streptin were purified to homogeneity from 95% acidified (pH 2) methanol extracts 
      of S. pyogenes M25 cells by using a series of reversed-phase chromatographic 
      separations. The fully processed form of streptin (streptin 1) is a 23-amino-acid 
      peptide with a mass of 2,424 Da. The 2,821-M(r) form of the peptide (streptin 2) has 
      three additional amino acids (TPY) at the N terminus. Strain M25 extracts also 
      contained small quantities of the streptin 1 and streptin 2 peptides in various 
      stages of dehydration. Streptin 1 and streptin 2 were each capable of specifically 
      inducing streptin production when added to strain M25 cultures. The streptin gene 
      cluster resembled that of other type A1 lantibiotics but appeared to lack a 
      streptin-specific proteinase gene. Although the streptin structural gene (srtA) was 
      widespread within S. pyogenes, being detected in 40 of 58 strains, each representing 
      a different M serotype, only 10 of these srtA-positive strains produced active 
      streptin. The failure of some strains to express streptin was attributed to an 
      approximately 4.5-kb deletion in their streptin loci, encompassing genes putatively 
      encoding proteins involved in streptin processing (srtB and srtC) and transport 
      (srtT). In other strains, srtA transcription appeared to be defective. No direct 
      association could be detected between the production of streptin and the production 
      of the lantibiotic-like hemolysin streptolysin S in strain M25.

TI  - Roles of sortase in surface expression of the major protein adhesin P1, 
      saliva-induced aggregation and adherence, and cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans.
PG  - 676-81
AB  - Sortase is a newly discovered transpeptidase that covalently links LPXTGX-containing 
      surface proteins to the gram-positive bacterial cell wall. In this study, the 
      sortase gene (srtA) was isolated from Streptococcus mutans NG8 by PCR. The gene 
      encoded a 246-amino-acid protein, including a 40-amino-acid signal peptide. The srtA 
      gene was insertionally inactivated by a tetracycline resistance cassette. P1, a 
      major surface protein adhesin previously shown to anchor to the peptidoglycan by the 
      LPXTGX motif, was secreted into the culture medium by the srtA mutant. In contrast, 
      the wild-type P1 remained cell wall associated. Complementation of the mutant with 
      srtA restored the P1 surface expression phenotype. P1 produced by the mutant, but 
      not that produced by the wild type and the srtA-complemented mutant, was recognized 
      by an antibody raised against the hydrophobic domain and charged tail C terminal to 
      the LPXTGX motif. These results suggest that the failure to anchor P1 to the cell 
      wall is due to the lack of cleavage of P1 at the LPXTGX motif. The srtA mutant was 
      markedly less hydrophobic than the wild type and the complemented mutant. The srtA 
      mutant failed to aggregate in the presence of saliva or salivary agglutinin and 
      adhered poorly to saliva- or salivary agglutinin-coated hydroxylapatite. In rats, 
      the srtA mutant colonized the teeth poorly when sucrose was absent. When sucrose was 
      present, the srtA mutant colonized the teeth but less effectively and induced 
      significantly less caries (P < 0.05) than the wild-type strain. In conclusion, the 
      sortase enzyme in S. mutans is responsible for anchoring P1 to the cell surface and 
      plays a role in modulating the surface properties and cariogenicity of S. mutans.

TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase 
      of gram-positive bacteria.
PG  - 971-82
AB  - Many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive 
      bacteria have a consensus C-terminal motif, Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG). This sequence 
      is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a 
      cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. Using the 
      type strain of Streptococcus suis, NCTC 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins 
      that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide 
      sequences of the genetic regions. One gene, designated srtA, was linked to gyrA, as 
      were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. Three genes, 
      designated srtB, srtC, and srtD, were tandemly clustered in a different location, 
      where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 
      bp in close vicinity. The remaining gene, designated srtE, was located separately on 
      the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. The deduced amino 
      acid sequences of the five Srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases 
      of Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus, except that SrtA of S. suis had 
      65% identity with that of S. gordonii. Isogenic mutants deficient for srtA, srtBCD, 
      or srtE were generated by allelic exchanges. The protein fraction which was released 
      from partially purified cell walls by digestion with N-acetylmuramidase was profiled 
      by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 15 of the protein spots were 
      missing in the profile of the srtA mutant compared with that of the parent strain, 
      and this phenotype was completely complemented by srtA cloned from S. suis. Four 
      genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. 
      The deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the LPXTG motif in 
      their C-terminal regions. On the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in 
      the srtA mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtBCD and srtE mutants. These 
      results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srtA is also 
      present in S. suis.

LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.9b00407 [doi]
AB  - The functions of enzymes can be strongly affected by their higher-order spatial 
      arrangements. In this study we combine multiple new technologies-designer protein 
      cages and sortase-based enzymatic attachments between proteins-as a novel platform 
      for organizing multiple enzymes (of one or more types) in specified configurations. 
      As a scaffold we employ a previously characterized 24-subunit designed protein cage 
      whose termini are outwardly exposed for attachment. As a first-use case, we test the 
      attachment of two cellulase enzymes known to act synergistically in cellulose 
      degradation. We show that, after endowing the termini of the cage subunits with a 
      short "sort-tag" sequence (LPXTG) and the opposing termini of the cellulase enzymes 
      with a short polyglycine sequence tag, addition of sortase covalently attaches the 
      enzymes to the cage with good reactivity and high copy number. The doubly modified 
      cages show enhanced activity in a cellulose degradation assay compared to enzymes in 
      solution, and compared to a combination of singly modified cages. These new 
      engineering strategies could be broadly useful in the development of enzymatic 
      material and synthetic biology applications.

AB  - Sortases are cysteine transpeptidases that assemble surface proteins and pili in 
      their cell envelope. Encoded by all Gram-positive bacteria, few Gram-negative 
      bacteria and archaea, sortases are currently divided into six classes (A-F). Due to 
      the steep increase in bacterial genome data in recent years, the number of sortase 
      homologues have also escalated rapidly. In this study, we used protein sequence 
      similarity networks to explore the taxonomic diversity of sortases and also to 
      evaluate the current classification of these enzymes. The resultant data suggest 
      that sortase classes A, B, and D predominate in Firmicutes and classes E and F are 
      enriched in Actinobacteria, whereas class C is distributed in both Firmicutes and 
      Actinobacteria except Streptomyces family. Sortases were also observed in various 
      Gram-negatives and euryarchaeota, which should be recognized as novel classes of 
      sortases. Motif analysis around the catalytic cysteine was also performed and 
      suggested that the residue at 2(nd) position from cysteine may help distinguish 
      various sortase classes. Moreover, the sequence analysis indicated that the 
      catalytic arginine is highly conserved in almost all classes except sortase F in 
      which arginine is replaced by asparagine in Actinobacteria. Additionally, class A 
      sortases showed higher structural variation as compared to other sortases, whereas 
      inter-class comparisons suggested structures of class C and D2 exhibited best 
      similarities. A better understanding of the residues highlighted in this study 
      should be helpful in elucidating their roles in substrate binding and the sortase 
      function, and successively could help in the development of strong sortase 
      inhibitors.

TI  - Influence of adhesion and bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus salivarius on the 
      intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response.
PG  - 5196-203
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00507-12 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus salivarius strain UCC118 is a human intestinal isolate that has been 
      extensively studied for its potential probiotic effects in human and animal models. 
      The objective of this study was to determine the effect of L. salivarius UCC118 on 
      gene expression responses in the Caco-2 cell line to improve understanding of how 
      the strain might modulate intestinal epithelial cell phenotypes. Exposure of Caco-2 
      cells to UCC118 led to the induction of several human genes (TNFAIP3, NFKBIA, and 
      BIRC3) that are negative regulators of inflammatory signaling pathways. Induction of 
      chemokines (CCL20, CXCL-1, and CXCL-2) with antimicrobial functions was also 
      observed. Disruption of the UCC118 sortase gene srtA causes reduced bacterial 
      adhesion to epithelial cells. Transcription of three mucin genes was reduced 
      significantly when Caco-2 cells were stimulated with the ΔsrtA derivative of UCC118 
      compared to cells stimulated with the wild type, but there was no significant change 
      in the transcription levels of the anti-inflammatory genes. UCC118 genes that were 
      significantly upregulated upon exposure to Caco-2 cells were identified by bacterial 
      genome microarray and consisted primarily of two groups of genes connected with 
      purine metabolism and the operon for synthesis of the Abp118 bacteriocin. Following 
      incubation with Caco-2 cells, the bacteriocin synthesis genes were transcribed at 
      higher levels in the wild type than in the ΔsrtA derivative. These data indicate 
      that L. salivarius UCC118 influences epithelial cells both through modulation of the 
      inflammatory response and by modulation of intestinal cell mucin production. 
      Sortase-anchored cell surface proteins of L. salivarius UCC118 have a central role 
      in promoting the interaction between the bacterium and epithelial cells.

TI  - Mannose-specific interaction of Lactobacillus plantarum with porcine jejunal 
      epithelium.
PG  - 215-23

AB  - Host-microorganism interactions in the intestinal tract are complex, and little is 
      known about specific nonpathogenic microbial factors triggering host responses in 
      the gut. In this study, mannose-specific interactions of Lactobacillus plantarum 
      299v with jejunal epithelium were investigated using an in situ pig Small Intestinal 
      Segment Perfusion model. The effects of L. plantarum 299v wild-type strain were 
      compared with those of two corresponding mutant strains either lacking the gene 
      encoding for the mannose-specific adhesin (msa) or sortase (srtA; responsible for 
      anchoring of cell surface proteins like Msa to the cell wall). A slight enrichment 
      of the wild-type strain associated with the intestinal surface could be observed 
      after 8 h of perfusion when a mixture of wild-type and msa-mutant strain had been 
      applied. In contrast to the mutant strains, the L. plantarum wild-type strain tended 
      to induce a decrease in jejunal net fluid absorption compared with control 
      conditions. Furthermore, after 8 h of perfusion expression of the host gene encoding 
      pancreatitis-associated protein, a protein with proposed bactericidal properties, 
      was found to be upregulated by the wild-type strain only. These observations suggest 
      a role of Msa in the induction of host responses in the pig intestine.

TI  - Anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus. Cysteine 
      184 and histidine 120 of sortase form a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair for catalysis.
PG  - 7447-52
AB  - Surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus are anchored to the cell wall 
      peptidoglycan by a mechanism requiring a C-terminal sorting signal with a LPXTG 
      motif. Sortase cleaves polypeptides between the threonine and the glycine of the 
      LPXTG motif. The carboxyl group of threonine is subsequently amide-linked to the 
      amino group of peptidoglycan cross-bridges. The three-dimensional structure of 
      sortase revealed the close proximity of the catalytic site residue cysteine 184 with 
      histidine 120; however, no structural evidence for a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair 
      could be detected. We report that alanine substitution of either cysteine 184 or 
      histidine 120 abolishes in vivo and in vitro sorting reactions. Further, alanine 
      substitution of tryptophan 194, a residue that is in close proximity of histidine 
      120, reduces the transpeptidase activity of sortase. These results suggest a model 
      whereby sortase forms a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair for the catalysis of its 
      transpeptidation reaction and that the position of tryptophan 194 assists in the 
      formation of this ion pair.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hymenocallis littoralis (Jacq.) Salisb. has been 
      referred as beach spider lily and commonly known for its rich phytochemical 
      diversity. Phytochemicals such as alkaloids, volatile constituents, phenols, 
      flavonoids, flavonols extracted from different parts of these plants like bulbs, 
      flowers, leaf, stem and root had been used in folk medicines from ancient times 
      because of their excellent antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The leaf and 
      bulb extract of H. littoralis plant was traditionally used for wound healing. 
      Alkaloids extracted from bulb of this plant possess anti-viral, anti-neoplastic and 
      cytotoxic properties. However, these phytochemicals have also shown antibiofilm 
      activity, which is considered as one of the important factor accountable for the 
      drug resistance in microorganisms. Thus, the investigation of medicinal properties 
      of H. littoralis could be useful to control biofilm producing pathogens. AIM OF THE 
      STUDY: Explore antimicrobial, antibiofilm and antioxidant potentials of H. 
      littoralis against pathogenic microorganisms using experimental and computational 
      biology approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytochemical extraction from dried powder 
      of H. littoralis leaves was done by solvent extraction using methanol. Antimicrobial 
      and antibiofilm activities of leaves extract were carried out using agar well 
      diffusion method, growth curve, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Scanning 
      Electron Microscopy (SEM). Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy (LCMS) 
      technique was used for the identification of phytochemicals. Molecular docking 
      studies of antibiofilm agents with adhesin proteins were performed using Autodock 
      4.2. Antioxidant activity of extract was carried out by FRAP assay. The noxious 
      effect of extract was investigated by histological studies on rat skin. RESULTS: The 
      preliminary phytochemical analysis of methanolic leaves extract revealed the 
      presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoid, glycosides, terpene, terpenoids and 
      phenolics. The various phytochemicals such as Apigenin 7-(4'', 6'' 
      diacetylalloside)-4'- alloside, Catechin 7-O- apiofuranoside, Emodic acid, 
      Epicatechin 3-O- β-D-glucopyranoside, 4 - Methylesculetin, Methylisoeugenol, 
      Quercetin 5,7,3',4'-tetramethyl ether 3-rutinoside, 4 - Methylumbelliferyl β-D- 
      glucuronide were extracted, characterized and recognized from the leaves extract of 
      H. littoralis. The identification of these phytochemicals was performed using LC-MS. 
      The antimicrobial property of H. littoralis leaf extract was investigated against 
      different pathogenic microorganisms. Out of these tested microorganisms, promising 
      antibiofilm and antimicrobial activities were confirmed against S. aureus NCIM 2654 
      and C. albicans NCIM 3466 by using growth curve and SEM analysis. MIC of this leaf 
      extract was identified as 45 µg/ml and 70 µg/ml for S. aureus NCIM 2654 and C. 
      albicans NCIM 3466 respectively. The leaves extract also showed good antioxidant 
      activity due to presence of phenols and flavonoids. Molecular docking of these 
      identified antibiofilm components interacts with the active site residues of adhesin 
      proteins, Sortase A and Als3 from S. aureus and C. albicans respectively. 
      Histological studies of extracted phytochemicals revealed non-noxious effects on rat 
      skin. CONCLUSION: Thus, the present study revealed that the leaves extract of H. 
      littoralis contains various phytochemicals having good extent of antimicrobial, 
      antibiofilm and antioxidant properties. The in-vitro and in-silico results would be 
      useful to design new lead compounds against biofilm producing pathogenic 
      microorganisms.

TI  - Scutellarin potentiates vancomycin against lethal pneumonia caused by 
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus through dual inhibition of sortase A and 
      caseinolytic peptidase P.

AB  - The strategy of targeting virulence factor has received great attention as it barely 
      develops bacterial resistance. Sortase A (SrtA) and caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), 
      as important virulence factors, are considered to be ideal pharmacological targets 
      for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Through screening 
      hundreds of compounds, we found scutellarin, a natural flavonoid, markedly inhibited 
      SrtA and ClpP activities of MRSA strain USA300 with an IC(50) of 53.64 μg/mL and 
      107.00 μg/mL, respectively. Subsequently, we observed that scutellarin could inhibit 
      the SrtA-related virulence of MRSA. To demonstrate whether scutellarin directly 
      binding to SrtA, fluorescence quenching assay and molecular docking were performed 
      and the results indicated that scutellarin directly bonded to SrtA molecule with a 
      K(A) value of 7.58 × 10(4) L/mol. In addition to direct SrtA inhibition, scutellarin 
      could also inhibit hemolytic activity of S. aureus by inhibiting the expression of 
      Hla in a SrtA-independent manner. Further assays confirmed that scutellarin 
      inhibited hemolysis by inhibiting ClpP. The combination of scutellarin and 
      vancomycin showed enhancing inhibition of USA300 in vitro and in vivo, evidenced by 
      decreased MIC from 3 μg/mL to 0.5 μg/mL and increased survival and improvement of 
      lung pathology in pneumonia mice. Taken together, these results suggest that 
      scutellarin exhibited di-inhibitory effects on SrtA and ClpP of USA300. The 
      di-inhibition of virulence factors by scutellarin combined with vancomycin to 
      prevent MRSA invasion of A549 cells and pneumonia in mice, indicating that 
      scutellarin is expected to be a potential adjuvant against MRSA in the future.

TI  - Targeting Bacterial Sortases in Search of Anti-Virulence Therapies with Low Risk of 
      Resistance Development.
LID - 10.3390/ph14050415 [doi]
LID - 415
AB  - Increasingly ineffective antibiotics and rapid spread of multi- and pan-resistant 
      bacteria represent a global health threat; hence, the need of developing new 
      antimicrobial medicines. A first step in this direction is identifying new molecular 
      targets, such as virulence factors. Sortase A represents a virulence factor 
      essential for the pathogenesis of Gram-positive pathogens, some of which have a high 
      risk for human health. We present here an exhaustive collection of sortases 
      inhibitors grouped by relevant chemical features: vinyl sulfones, 3-aryl acrylic 
      acids and derivatives, flavonoids, naphtoquinones, anthraquinones, indoles, 
      pyrrolomycins, isoquinoline derivatives, aryl β-aminoethyl ketones, pyrazolethiones, 
      pyridazinones, benzisothiazolinones, 2-phenyl-benzoxazole and 2-phenyl-benzofuran 
      derivatives, thiadiazoles, triazolothiadiazoles, 2-(2-phenylhydrazinylidene)alkanoic 
      acids, and 1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione. This review focuses on highlighting 
      their structure-activity relationships, using the half maximal inhibitory 
      concentration (IC(50)), when available, as an indicator of each compound effect on a 
      specific sortase. The information herein is useful for acquiring knowledge on 
      diverse natural and synthetic sortases inhibitors scaffolds and for understanding 
      the way their structural variations impact IC(50). It will hopefully be the 
      inspiration for designing novel effective and safe sortase inhibitors in order to 
      create new anti-infective compounds and to help overcoming the current worldwide 
      antibiotic shortage.

TI  - Greatest Hits-Innovative Technologies for High Throughput Identification of 
      Bispecific Antibodies.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21186551 [doi]
LID - 6551
AB  - Recent years have shown a tremendous increase and diversification in antibody-based 
      therapeutics with advances in production techniques and formats. The plethora of 
      currently investigated bi- to multi-specific antibody architectures can be harnessed 
      to elicit a broad variety of specific modes of actions in oncology and immunology, 
      spanning from enhanced selectivity to effector cell recruitment, all of which cannot 
      be addressed by monospecific antibodies. Despite continuously growing efforts and 
      methodologies, the identification of an optimal bispecific antibody as the best 
      possible combination of two parental monospecific binders, however, remains 
      challenging, due to tedious cloning and production, often resulting in undesired 
      extended development times and increased expenses. Although automated high 
      throughput screening approaches have matured for pharmaceutical small molecule 
      development, it was only recently that protein bioconjugation technologies have been 
      developed for the facile generation of bispecific antibodies in a 'plug and play' 
      manner. In this review, we provide an overview of the most relevant methodologies 
      for bispecific screening purposes-the DuoBody concept, paired light chain single 
      cell production approaches, Sortase A and Transglutaminase, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher 
      system, and inteins-and elaborate on the benefits as well as drawbacks of the 
      different technologies.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of antibiofilm compound 1 against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.

AB  - A novel benzimidazole molecule that was identified in a small-molecule screen and is 
      known as antibiofilm compound 1 (ABC-1) has been found to prevent bacterial biofilm 
      formation by multiple bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, without 
      affecting bacterial growth. Here, the biofilm inhibiting ability of 156 μM ABC-1 was 
      tested in various biofilm-forming strains of S. aureus. It was demonstrated that 
      ABC-1 inhibits biofilm formation by these strains at micromolar concentrations 
      regardless of the strains' dependence on Polysaccharide Intercellular Adhesin (PIA), 
      cell wall-associated protein dependent or cell wall- associated extracellular DNA 
      (eDNA). Of note, ABC-1 treatment primarily inhibited Protein A (SpA) expression in 
      all strains tested. spa gene disruption showed decreased biofilm formation; however, 
      the mutants still produced more biofilm than ABC-1 treated strains, implying that 
      ABC-1 affects not only SpA but also other factors. Indeed, ABC-1 also attenuated the 
      accumulation of PIA and eDNA on cell surface. Our results suggest that ABC-1 has 
      pleotropic effects on several biofilm components and thus inhibits biofilm formation 
      by S. aureus.

TI  - Functional identification of conserved residues involved in Lactobacillus rhamnosus 
      strain GG sortase specificity and pilus biogenesis.
PG  - 15764-75
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.542332 [doi]
AB  - In Gram-positive bacteria, sortase-dependent pili mediate the adhesion of bacteria 
      to host epithelial cells and play a pivotal role in colonization, host signaling, 
      and biofilm formation. Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG, a well known probiotic 
      bacterium, also displays on its cell surface mucus-binding pilus structures, along 
      with other LPXTG surface proteins, which are processed by sortases upon specific 
      recognition of a highly conserved LPXTG motif. Bioinformatic analysis of all 
      predicted LPXTG proteins encoded by the L. rhamnosus GG genome revealed a remarkable 
      conservation of glycine residues juxtaposed to the canonical LPXTG motif. Here, we 
      investigated and defined the role of this so-called triple glycine (TG) motif in 
      determining sortase specificity during the pilus assembly and anchoring. Mutagenesis 
      of the TG motif resulted in a lack or an alteration of the L. rhamnosus GG pilus 
      structures, indicating that the TG motif is critical in pilus assembly and that they 
      govern the pilin-specific and housekeeping sortase specificity. This allowed us to 
      propose a regulatory model of the L. rhamnosus GG pilus biogenesis. Remarkably, the 
      TG motif was identified in multiple pilus gene clusters of other Gram-positive 
      bacteria, suggesting that similar signaling mechanisms occur in other, mainly 
      pathogenic, species.

      site-specific bioconjugation into a single step.
PG  - 11090-7
LID - 10.1021/ac402871k [doi]
AB  - Efficient labeling of protein-based targeting ligands with various cargos (drugs, 
      imaging agents, nanoparticles, etc.) is essential to the fields of molecular imaging 
      and targeted therapeutics. Many common bioconjugation techniques, however, are 
      inefficient, nonstoichiometric, not site-specific, and/or incompatible with certain 
      classes of protein scaffolds. Additionally, these techniques can result in a mixture 
      of conjugated and unconjugated products, which are often difficult to separate. In 
      this study, a bacterial sortase enzyme was utilized to condense targeting ligand 
      purification and site-specific conjugation at the C-terminus into a single step. A 
      model was produced to determine optimal reaction conditions for high conjugate 
      purity and efficient utilization of cargo. As proof-of-principle, the sortase-tag 
      expressed protein ligation (STEPL) technique was used to generate tumor-specific 
      affinity ligands with fluorescent labels and/or azide modifications at high purity 
      (>95%) such that it was not necessary to remove unconjugated impurities. Click 
      chemistry was then used for the highly efficient and site-specific attachment of the 
      azide-modified targeting ligands onto nanoparticles.

TI  - Sortases and the art of anchoring proteins to the envelopes of gram-positive 
      bacteria.
PG  - 192-221
AB  - The cell wall envelopes of gram-positive bacteria represent a surface organelle that 
      not only functions as a cytoskeletal element but also promotes interactions between 
      bacteria and their environment. Cell wall peptidoglycan is covalently and 
      noncovalently decorated with teichoic acids, polysaccharides, and proteins. The sum 
      of these molecular decorations provides bacterial envelopes with species- and 
      strain-specific properties that are ultimately responsible for bacterial virulence, 
      interactions with host immune systems, and the development of disease symptoms or 
      successful outcomes of infections. Surface proteins typically carry two topogenic 
      sequences, i.e., N-terminal signal peptides and C-terminal sorting signals. Sortases 
      catalyze a transpeptidation reaction by first cleaving a surface protein substrate 
      at the cell wall sorting signal. The resulting acyl enzyme intermediates between 
      sortases and their substrates are then resolved by the nucleophilic attack of amino 
      groups, typically provided by the cell wall cross bridges of peptidoglycan 
      precursors. The surface protein linked to peptidoglycan is then incorporated into 
      the envelope and displayed on the microbial surface. This review focuses on the 
      mechanisms of surface protein anchoring to the cell wall envelope by sortases and 
      the role that these enzymes play in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.

TI  - Conserved residues are critical for Haloferax volcanii archaeosortase catalytic 
      activity: Implications for convergent evolution of the catalytic mechanisms of 
      non-homologous sortases from archaea and bacteria.
PG  - 276-287
LID - 10.1111/mmi.13935 [doi]
AB  - Proper protein anchoring is key to the biogenesis of prokaryotic cell surfaces, 
      dynamic, resilient structures that play crucial roles in various cell processes. A 
      novel surface protein anchoring mechanism in Haloferax volcanii depends upon the 
      peptidase archaeosortase A (ArtA) processing C-termini of substrates containing 
      C-terminal tripartite structures and anchoring mature substrates to the cell 
      membrane via intercalation of lipid-modified C-terminal amino acid residues. While 
      this membrane protein lacks clear homology to soluble sortase transpeptidases of 
      Gram-positive bacteria, which also process C-termini of substrates whose C-terminal 
      tripartite structures resemble those of ArtA substrates, archaeosortases do contain 
      conserved cysteine, arginine and arginine/histidine/asparagine residues, reminiscent 
      of His-Cys-Arg residues of sortase catalytic sites. The study presented here shows 
      that ArtA(WT) -GFP expressed in trans complements ΔartA growth and motility 
      phenotypes, while alanine substitution mutants, Cys(173) (C173A), Arg(214) (R214A) 
      or Arg(253) (R253A), and the serine substitution mutant for Cys(173) (C173S), fail 
      to complement these phenotypes. Consistent with sortase active site replacement 
      mutants, ArtA(C173A) -GFP, ArtA(C173S) -GFP and ArtA(R214A) -GFP cannot process 
      substrates, while replacement of the third residue, ArtA(R253A) -GFP retains some 
      processing activity. These findings support the view that similarities between 
      certain aspects of the structures and functions of the sortases and archaeosortases 
      are the result of convergent evolution.

AB  - Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are highly potent and specific antitumor drugs, 
      combining the specific targeting of mAbs with the potency of small-molecule toxic 
      payloads. ADCs generated by conventional chemical conjugation yield heterogeneous 
      mixtures with variable pharmacokinetics, stability, safety, and efficacy profiles. 
      To address these issues, numerous site-specific conjugation technologies are 
      currently being developed allowing the manufacturing of homogeneous ADCs with 
      predetermined drug-to-antibody ratios. Here, we used sortase-mediated antibody 
      conjugation (SMAC) technology to generate homogeneous ADCs based on a derivative of 
      the highly potent anthracycline toxin PNU-159682 and a noncleavable peptide linker, 
      using the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (part of Kadcyla) and the anti-CD30 
      antibody cAC10 (part of Adcetris). Characterization of the resulting ADCs in vitro 
      and in vivo showed that they were highly stable and exhibited potencies exceeding 
      those of ADCs based on conventional tubulin-targeting payloads, such as Kadcyla and 
      Adcetris. The data presented here suggest that such novel and highly potent ADC 
      formats may help to increase the number of targets available to ADC approaches, by 
      reducing the threshold levels of target expression required. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(5);

AB  - Current techniques to characterize leukocyte subgroups in blood require long sample 
      preparation times and sizable sample volumes. A simplified method for leukocyte 
      characterization using smaller blood volumes would thus be useful in diagnostic 
      settings. Here we describe a flow system comprised of two functionalized graphene 
      oxide (GO) surfaces that allow the capture of distinct leukocyte populations from 
      small volumes blood using camelid single-domain antibodyfragments (VHHs) as capture 
      agents. We used site-specifically labeled leukocytes to detect and identify cells 
      exposed to fungal challenge. Combining the chemical and optical properties of GO 
      with the versatility of the VHH scaffold in the context of a flow system provides a 
      quick and efficient method for the capture and characterization of functional 
      leukocytes.

AB  - A major disadvantage of therapeutic proteins is their instability to external 
      stressors during storage, transport and use. Here, we report site-specific in situ 
      growth of a cyclized protein-polymer conjugate with improved in vitro and in vivo 
      stability. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) was genetically fused at its N- and 
      C-termini with two sortase recognition sequences pentaglycine and LPETG, 
      respectively to yield a linear GFP (l-GFP). A cyclized GFP (c-GFP) was generated 
      from the l-GFP by sortase-catalyzed cyclization. A maleimide-functionalized atom 
      transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator was selectively attached to a free 
      cysteine residue genetically engineered at the C-terminus of GFP to form a 
      macroinitiator (c-GFP-Br). Subsequent in situ ATRP of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl 
      ether methacrylate (OEGMA) from the c-GFP-Br generated a site-specific (C-terminal) 
      and stoichiometric (1:1) c-GFP-POEGMA conjugate with almost quantitative conversion 
      and highly retained activity. Notably, the c-GFP-POEGMA conjugate showed 9- and 
      310-fold increases in thermal stability as compared to the l-GFP and its counterpart 
      l-GFP-POEGMA, respectively. Additionally, the conjugate displayed significantly 
      improved tumor retention relative to the l-GFP and l-GFP-POEGMA. The method 
      developed may be applicable to a variety of therapeutic proteins to improve their 
      in vitro and in vivo stability.

PG  - 311-321
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000007 [doi]
AB  - Surface proteins of probiotic microbes, including Lactobacillus acidophilus and 
      Lactobacillus gasseri, are believed to promote retention in the gut and mediate 
      host-bacterial communications. Sortase, an enzyme that covalently couples a subset 
      of extracellular proteins containing an LPXTG motif to the cell surface, is of 
      particular interest in characterizing bacterial adherence and communication with the 
      mucosal immune system. A sortase gene, srtA, was identified in L. acidophilus NCFM 
      (LBA1244) and L. gasseri ATCC 33323 (LGAS_0825). Additionally, eight and six intact 
      sortase-dependent proteins were predicted in L. acidophilus and L. gasseri, 
      respectively. Due to the role of sortase in coupling these proteins to the cell 
      wall, ΔsrtA deletion mutants of L. acidophilus and L. gasseri were created using the 
      upp-based counterselective gene replacement system. Inactivation of sortase did not 
      cause significant alteration in growth or survival in simulated gastrointestinal 
      juices. Meanwhile, both ΔsrtA mutants showed decreased adhesion to porcine mucin in 
      vitro. Murine dendritic cells exposed to the ΔsrtA mutant of L. acidophilus or L. 
      gasseri induced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-12, 
      respectively, compared with the parent strains. In vivo co-colonization of the L. 
      acidophilus ΔsrtA mutant and its parent strain in germ-free 129S6/SvEv mice resulted 
      in a significant one-log reduction of the ΔsrtA mutant population. Additionally, a 
      similar reduction of the ΔsrtA mutant was observed in the caecum. This study shows 
      for the first time that sortase-dependent proteins contribute to gut retention of 
      probiotic microbes in the gastrointestinal tract.

      investigated the incorporation of each subunit into pili and the reliance of such 
      placement on each of the other subunits. Both accessory subunits RrgA and RrgC are 
      present in similar quantities in pili of all sizes. However, neither protein is 
      required for the polymerization of RrgB, suggesting a nonessential role for RrgA and 
      RrgC in the initiation of pilus assembly. Additionally, the rlrA islet encodes three 
      sortases, SrtC-1, SrtC-2, and SrtC-3 (formerly SrtB, SrtC, and SrtD), which are 
      divergent in sequence from the housekeeping sortase, SrtA. We determined the 
      contributions of these four sortases to pilus assembly and found that SrtA is 
      dispensable for pilus assembly and localization to the cell wall. Instead, SrtC-1, 
      SrtC-2, and SrtC-3 are responsible for pilus assembly and exhibit functional 
      redundancy with respect to backbone assembly and cell wall localization. A level of 
      specificity and coordination among the class C sortases was revealed by the finding 
      that SrtC-1 and SrtC-3 are required for the incorporation of the accessory subunits 
      and by showing a deleterious effect on pilus assembly upon alteration of the cell 
      wall sorting signals of the accessory subunit proteins.

AB  - An engineered cyanovirin-N homologue that exhibits specificity for high mannose 
      N-glycans has been constructed to aid type I α 1,2-mannosidase inhibitor discovery 
      and development. Engineering the lectins C-terminus permitted facile 
      functionalization with fluorophores via a sortase and click strategy. The resulting 
      lectin constructs exhibit specificity for cells presenting high mannose N-glycans. 
      Importantly, these lectin constructs can also be applied to specifically assess 
      changes in cell surface glycosylation induced by type I mannosidase inhibitors. 
      Testing the utility of these lectin constructs led to the discovery of type I 
      mannosidase inhibitors with nanomolar potency. Cumulatively, these findings reveal 
      the specificity and utility of the functionalized cyanovirin-N homologue constructs, 
      and highlight their potential in analytical contexts that require high 
      mannose-specific lectins.

TI  - In Streptomyces lividans, acetyl-CoA synthetase activity is controlled by O-serine 
      and N(ɛ) -lysine acetylation.
PG  - 577-594
LID - 10.1111/mmi.13901 [doi]
AB  - Protein acetylation is a rapid mechanism for control of protein function. Acetyl-CoA 
      synthetase (AMP-forming, Acs) is the paradigm for the control of metabolic enzymes 
      by lysine acetylation. In many bacteria, type I or II protein acetyltransferases 
      acetylate Acs, however, in actinomycetes type III protein acetyltransferases control 
      the activity of Acs. We measured changes in the activity of the Streptomyces 
      lividans Acs (SlAcs) enzyme upon acetylation by PatB using in vitro and in vivo 
      analyses. In addition to the acetylation of residue K610, residue S608 within the 
      acetylation motif of SlAcs was also acetylated (PKTRSGK(610) ). S608 acetylation 
      rendered SlAcs inactive and non-acetylatable by PatB. It is unclear whether 
      acetylation of S608 is enzymatic, but it was clear that this modification occurred 
      in vivo in Streptomyces. In S. lividans, an NAD(+) -dependent sirtuin deacetylase 
      from Streptomyces, SrtA (a homologue of the human SIRT4 protein) was needed to 
      maintain SlAcs function in vivo. We have characterized a sirtuin-dependent 
      reversible lysine acetylation system in Streptomyces lividans that targets and 
      controls the Acs enzyme of this bacterium. These studies raise questions about 
      acetyltransferase specificity, and describe the first Acs enzyme in any organism 
      whose activity is modulated by O-Ser and N(ɛ) -Lys acetylation.

TI  - A human pathogenic bacterial infection model using the two-spotted cricket, Gryllus 
      bimaculatus.

LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnw163 [doi]
AB  - Invertebrate animal species that can withstand temperatures as high as 37°C, the 
      human body temperature, are limited. In the present study, we utilized the 
      two-spotted cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, which lives in tropical and subtropical 
      regions, as an animal model of human pathogenic bacterial infection. Injection of 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus into the hemolymph killed crickets. 
      Injected P. aeruginosa or S. aureus proliferated in the hemolymph until the cricket 
      died. The ability of these pathogenic bacteria to kill the crickets was blocked by 
      the administration of antibiotics. S. aureus gene-knockout mutants of virulence 
      factors, including cvfA, agr and srtA, exhibited decreased killing ability compared 
      with the parent strain. The dose at which 50% of crickets were killed by P. 
      aeruginosa or S. aureus was not decreased at 37°C compared with that at 27°C. 
      Injection of Listeria monocytogenes, which upregulates toxin expression at 37°C, 
      killed crickets, and the dose at which 50% of crickets were killed was decreased at 
      37°C compared with that at 27°C. These findings suggest that the two-spotted cricket 
      is a useful model animal for evaluating the virulence properties of various human 
      pathogenic bacteria at variable temperature including 37°C.

TI  - Role of the Sortase A in the Release of Cell-Wall Proteinase PrtS in the Growth 
      Medium of Streptococcus thermophilus 4F44.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9112380 [doi]
LID - 2380
AB  - Growth of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus in milk depends on 
      its capacity to hydrolyze proteins of this medium through its surface proteolytic 
      activity. Thus, strains exhibiting the cell envelope proteinase (CEP) PrtS are able 
      to grow in milk at high cellular density. Due to its LPNTG motif, which is possibly 
      the substrate of the sortase A (SrtA), PrtS is anchored to the cell wall in most S. 
      thermophilus strains. Conversely, a soluble extracellular PrtS activity has been 
      reported in the strain 4F44. It corresponds, in fact, to a certain proportion of 
      PrtS that is not anchored to the cell wall but rather is released in the growth 
      medium. The main difference between PrtS of strain 4F44 (PrtS(4F44)) and other PrtS 
      concerns the absence of a 32-residue imperfect duplication in the prodomain of the 
      CEP, postulated as being required for the maturation and correct subsequent 
      anchoring of PrtS. In fact, both mature (without the prodomain at the N-terminal 
      extremity) and immature (with the prodomain) forms are found in the soluble 
      PrtS(4F44) form along with an intact LPNTG at their C-terminal extremity. 
      Investigations we present in this work show that (i) the imperfect duplication is 
      not implied in PrtS maturation; (ii) the maturase PrtM is irrelevant in PrtS 
      maturation which is probably automaturated; and (iii) SrtA allows for the PrtS 
      anchoring in S. thermophilus but the SrtA of strain 4F44 (SrtA(4F44)) displays an 
      altered activity.

AB  - Ever since the discovery of antibodies, they have been generated by complicated 
      multi-step procedures. Typically, these involve sequencing, cloning, and screening 
      after expression of the antibodies in a suitable organism and format. Here, a 
      staphylococcal nanobody display is described that omits many the abovementioned 
      intermediate steps and allows for simultaneous screening of multiple targets without 
      prior knowledge nor expression of the binders. This paper reports a detailed, 
      general step-by-step protocol to achieve nanobodies of high affinity. Apart from its 
      focus on radioactive and fluorescent targets, it gives options for various other 
      target formats and additional applications for the staphylococcal library; including 
      flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation. This provides a system for antibody 
      engineers that can be easily adopted to their specific needs.

TI  - Molecular docking based virtual screening of compounds for inhibiting sortase A in 
      L.monocytogenes.
PG  - 501-5
LID - 10.6026/97320630011501 [doi]
AB  - Listeriosis is considered as an important public health issue. Sortase A (srtA) is 
      an enzyme with catalytic role in L. monocytogenes that breaks the junction between 
      threonine and glycine in the LPXTG motif (a key motif in internalin A (InlA) that 
      plays an important role in listeriosis). Inactivation of srtA was shown to inhibit 
      anchoring of the invasion protein InIA. This is in addition to inhibiting 
      peptidoglycan-associated LPXTG proteins. Therefore, it is of interest to inhibit 
      strA using potential molecules. Here, we describe the design of an inhibitor with 
      high binding affinity to srtA with the ability to prevent the attachment of srtA to 
      the LPXTG proteins such as InIJ. A homology model of Listeria monocytogenes Sortase 
      A was developed using MODELLER (version 9.12). We screened StrA to 100,000 drug-like 
      ligands from the Zinc database using Molecular docking and virtual screening tool 
      PyRX). Pharmacokinetic analysis using the FAFDrugs(3) web server along with ADME and 
      toxicity analysis based on Lipinski rule of five were adopted for the screening 
      exercise followed by oral toxicity check using PROTOX (a server) for every 10 
      successive hits. The results from PROTOX server indicated that Lig #1 (with LD50 of 
      2000mg/kg) and Lig #7 (with LD50 of 2000mg/kg) have toxicity class 4 and Lig #3 
      (with LD50 of 14430mg/kg) has toxicity class 6. Subsequent modifications of these 
      structures followed by FAFDrugs(3) analysis for high bioavailability value selected 
      Lig #7 according to Lipinski rules of five. Thus, Lig #7 with IUPAC name 
      ((R)-4-{(S)-1-[(S)-2-Amino-4-methylvaleryl]-2-pyrrolidinyl}-1-[(S)-1-(ethylamino) 
      carbonyl-propylamino] -2-propyl-1, 4- butanedione) is suggested as a potential 
      candidate for srtA inhibition for further consideration.

TI  - A versatile approach for the site-specific modification of recombinant antibodies 
      using a combination of enzyme-mediated bioconjugation and click chemistry.
PG  - 7515-9
LID - 10.1002/anie.201411507 [doi]
AB  - A unique two-step modular system for site-specific antibody modification and 
      conjugation is reported. The first step of this approach uses enzymatic 
      bioconjugation with the transpeptidase Sortase A for incorporation of strained 
      cyclooctyne functional groups. The second step of this modular approach involves the 
      azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction. The versatility of the two-step approach 
      has been exemplified by the selective incorporation of fluorescent dyes and a 
      positron-emitting copper-64 radiotracer for fluorescence and positron-emission 
      tomography imaging of activated platelets, platelet aggregates, and thrombi, 
      respectively. This flexible and versatile approach could be readily adapted to 
      incorporate a large array of tailor-made functional groups using reliable click 
      chemistry whilst preserving the activity of the antibody or other sensitive 
      biological macromolecules.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture using hydrogel scaffolds can closely resemble 
      the natural extracellular matrix (ECM), which offers appropriate mechanical support 
      for cells and regulates cellular behavior. In this study, a bacterial transpeptidase 
      sortase A (SA) is used to prepare enzymatically cross-linked methacrylated 
      hyaluronic acid (HA) peptides (HAMA-P) hydrogel, which reveals fast gel kinetics 
      under high SA cross-linking concentrations and can be used as an injection hydrogel 
      for tissue repair or extrusive 3D bioprinting. Furthermore, methacrylated gelatin 
      (GelMA) is introduced to build the hybrid hydrogel (HAMA-P-GelMA) with double 
      cross-linking of enzyme-UV, which has shown proper physical properties (mechanical 
      properties, swelling, degradation rate, etc.) of the hydrogel matrix, and displayed 
      desirable effects on cell viability, adhesion, and cell spreading, when compared to 
      GelMA or HAMA-P single-network hydrogels. The HAMA-P-GelMA hybrid hydrogels provide 
      a favorable 3D milieu for cell growth and can be used as a 3D bio-ink or a carrier 
      of stem cells/cytokines for injectable tissue repair and filling.

      (pSiRM) structure modified with fluorogenic peptide substrate is demonstrated to 
      detect the presence of Sortase A (SrtA), a bacterial enzyme found in the cell 
      membrane protein of Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of fluorescence 
      enhancement effects of the pSiRM architecture with the incorporation of SrtA 
      fluorogenic peptide substrate within the pSi matrix enables the sensing of SrtA with 
      an outstanding limit of detection of 8 × 10(-14) m. Modification of the pSiRM 
      structure with microscale spots of two fluorogenic peptide substrates, one specific 
      for SrtA and the other for matrix metalloproteinases, effectively demonstrates the 
      feasibility to perform multiplexed biomarker analysis. The results in this study 
      highlight the potential of the pSiRM sensing platform as a point-of-care diagnostic 
      tool for biomarkers of bacterial wound infection.

AB  - The Sortase family of transpeptidases are found in numerous gram-positive bacteria 
      and involved in divergent physiological processes including anchoring of surface 
      proteins to the cell wall as well as pili assembly. As essential proteins, sortase 
      enzymes have been the focus of considerable interest for the development of novel 
      anti-microbials, however, more recently their function as unique transpeptidases has 
      been exploited for the synthesis of novel bio-conjugates. Yet, for synthetic 
      purposes, SrtA-mediated conjugation suffers from the enzyme's inherently poor 
      catalytic efficiency. Therefore, to identify SrtA variants with improved catalytic 
      efficiency, we used directed evolution to select a catalytically enhanced SrtA 
      enzyme. An analysis of improved SrtA variants in the context of sequence 
      conservation, NMR and x-ray crystal structures, and kinetic data suggests a novel 
      mechanism for catalysis involving large conformational changes that delivers 
      substrate to the active site pocket. Indeed, using DEER-EPR spectroscopy, we reveal 
      that upon substrate binding, SrtA undergoes a large scissors-like conformational 
      change that simultaneously translates the sort-tag substrate to the active site in 
      addition to repositioning key catalytic residues for esterification. A better 
      understanding of Sortase dynamics will significantly enhance future engineering and 
      drug discovery efforts.

TI  - Role of Lactobacillus reuteri cell and mucus-binding protein A (CmbA) in adhesion to 
      intestinal epithelial cells and mucus in vitro.
PG  - 671-681
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.073551-0 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri, a symbiotic inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract in 
      humans and animals, is marketed as a probiotic. The ability to adhere to intestinal 
      epithelial cells and mucus is an interesting property with regard to probiotic 
      features such as colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and interaction with the 
      host. Here, we present a study performed to elucidate the role of sortase (SrtA), 
      four putative sortase-dependent proteins (SDPs), and one C-terminal 
      membrane-anchored cell surface protein of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 in 
      adhesion to Caco-2 cells and mucus in vitro. This included mutagenesis of the genes 
      encoding these proteins and complementation of mutants. A null mutation in 
      hmpref0536_10255 encoding srtA resulted in significantly reduced adhesion to Caco-2 
      cells and mucus, indicating involvement of SDPs in adhesion. Evaluation of the 
      bacterial adhesion revealed that of the five putative surface protein mutants 
      tested, only a null mutation in the hmpref0536_10633 gene, encoding a putative SDP 
      with an LPxTG motif, resulted in a significant loss of adhesion to both Caco-2 cells 
      and mucus. Complementation with the functional gene on a plasmid restored adhesion 
      to Caco-2 cells. However, complete restoration of adhesion to mucus was not 
      achieved. Overexpression of hmpref0536_10633 in strain ATCC PTA 6475 resulted in an 
      increased adhesion to Caco-2 cells and mucus compared with the WT strain. We 
      conclude from these results that, among the putative surface proteins tested, the 
      protein encoded by hmpref0536_10633 plays a critical role in binding of 
      Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 to Caco-2 cells and mucus. Based on this, we 
      propose that this LPxTG motif containing protein should be referred to as cell and 
      mucus binding protein A (CmbA).

AB  - Pilin precursors are the building blocks of pili on the surface of Gram-positive 
      bacteria; however, the assembly mechanisms of these adhesive fibers are unknown. 
      Here, we describe the chemical bonds that assemble BcpA pilin subunits on the 
      surface of Bacillus cereus. Sortase D cleaves BcpA precursor between the threonine 
      (T) and the glycine (G) residues of its LPXTG sorting signal and catalyzes formation 
      of an amide bond between threonine (T) of the sorting signal and lysine (K) in the 
      YPKN motif of another BcpA subunit. Three CNA B domains of BcpA generate 
      intramolecular amide bonds, and one of these contributes also to pilus formation. 
      Conservation of catalysts and structural elements in pilin precursors in 
      Gram-positive bacteria suggests a universal mechanism of fiber assembly.

TI  - Putative surface proteins encoded within a novel transferable locus confer a 
      high-biofilm phenotype to Enterococcus faecalis.
PG  - 2063-72
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic pathogens and among the leading causes of nosocomial 
      infections. Enterococcus faecalis, the dominant species among infection-derived 
      isolates, has recently been recognized as capable of forming biofilms on abiotic 
      surfaces in vitro as well as on indwelling medical devices. A few bacterial factors 
      known to contribute to biofilm formation in E. faecalis have been characterized. To 
      identify additional factors which may be important to this process, we utilized a 
      Tn917-based insertional mutagenesis strategy to generate a mutant bank in a 
      high-biofilm-forming E. faecalis strain, E99. The resulting mutant bank was screened 
      for mutants exhibiting a significantly reduced ability to form biofilms. One mutant, 
      P101D12, which showed greater than 70% reduction in its ability to form biofilms 
      compared to the wild-type parent, was further characterized. The single Tn917 
      insertion in P101D12 was mapped to a gene, bee-2, encoding a probable cell 
      wall-anchored protein. Sequence information for the region flanking bee-2 revealed 
      that this gene was a member of a locus (termed the bee locus for biofilm enhancer in 
      enterococcus) comprised of five genes encoding three putative cell wall-anchored 
      proteins and two probable sortases. Contour-clamped homogeneous electric field gel 
      and Southern hybridization analyses suggested that the bee locus is likely harbored 
      on a large conjugative plasmid. Filter mating assays using wild-type E99 or mutant 
      P101D12 as a donor confirmed that the bee locus could transfer conjugally at high 
      frequency to recipient E. faecalis strains. This represents the first instance of 
      the identification of a mobile genetic element conferring biofilm-forming property 
      in E. faecalis.

      table olives were found to be resistant at least to three antibiotics (Casado Muñoz 
      et al., 2014); however, most were sensitive to the biocides tested in this study 
      (with minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC] below the epidemiological cut-off 
      values). 2-15% of the isolates were found to be biocide resistant: Leuconostoc 
      Pseudomesenteroides, which were resistant to hexachlorophene, and Lactobacillus 
      pentosus to cetrimide and hexadecylpiridinium. We analyzed the effect of different 
      physico-chemical stresses, including antimicrobials, on the phenotypic and genotypic 
      responses of LAB, providing new insights on how they become resistant in a changing 
      environment. Results indicated that similar phenotypic responses were obtained under 
      three stress conditions: antimicrobials, chemicals and UV light. Susceptibility 
      patterns to antibiotics changed: increasing MICs for ampicillin, chloramphenicol, 
      ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin and tetracycline, and decreasing the MICs for 
      clindamycin, erythromycin, streptomycin and trimethoprim in most strains. 
      Statistically, cross resistance between different antibiotics was detected in all 
      stress conditions. However, expression profiles of selected genes involved in 
      stress/resistance response (rpsL, recA, uvrB and srtA) differed depending on the 
      stress parameter, LAB species and strain, and the target gene. We conclude that, 
      despite the uniform phenotypic response to stresses, the repertoire of induced and 
      repressed genes differs. So, a search for a target to improve stress tolerance of 
      LAB, especially those of importance as starter/protective cultures or probiotics, 
      may depend on the individual screening of each strain, even though we could predict 
      the antibiotic phenotypic response to all stresses.

TI  - Solution structure of the sortase required for efficient production of infectious 
      Bacillus anthracis spores.
PG  - 7953-63
LID - 10.1021/bi300867t [doi]
AB  - Bacillus anthracis forms metabolically dormant endospores that upon germination can 
      cause lethal anthrax disease in humans. Efficient sporulation requires the activity 
      of the SrtC sortase (BaSrtC), a cysteine transpeptidase that covalently attaches the 
      BasH and BasI proteins to the peptidoglycan of the forespore and predivisional cell, 
      respectively. To gain insight into the molecular basis of protein display, we used 
      nuclear magnetic resonance to determine the structure and backbone dynamics of the 
      catalytic domain of BaSrtC (residues Ser(56)-Lys(198)). The backbone and heavy atom 
      coordinates of structurally ordered amino acids have coordinate precision of 0.42 ± 
      0.07 and 0.82 ± 0.05 Å, respectively. BaSrtC(Δ55) adopts an eight-stranded β-barrel 
      fold that contains two short helices positioned on opposite sides of the protein. 
      Surprisingly, the protein dimerizes and contains an extensive, structurally 
      disordered surface that is positioned adjacent to the active site. The surface is 
      formed by two loops (β2-β3 and β4-H1 loops) that surround the active site histidine, 
      suggesting that they may play a key role in associating BaSrtC with its lipid II 
      substrate. BaSrtC anchors proteins bearing a noncanonical LPNTA sorting signal. 
      Modeling studies suggest that the enzyme recognizes this substrate using a rigid 
      binding pocket and reveals the presence of a conserved subsite for the signal. This 
      first structure of a class D member of the sortase superfamily unveils 
      class-specific features that may facilitate ongoing efforts to discover sortase 
      inhibitors for the treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  - Analysis of the substrate specificity of the Staphylococcus aureus sortase 
      transpeptidase SrtA.
PG  - 1541-51
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus sortase transpeptidase SrtA isoform is responsible for the 
      covalent attachment of virulence and colonization-associated proteins to the 
      bacterial peptidoglycan. SrtA utilizes two substrates, 
      undecaprenol-pyrophosphoryl-MurNAc(GlcNAc)-Ala-D-isoGlu-Lys(epsilon-Gly(5))-D-Ala-D-Ala 
      (branched Lipid II) and secreted proteins containing a highly conserved C-terminal 
      LPXTG sequence. SrtA simultaneously cleaves the Thr-Gly bond of the LPXTG-containing 
      protein and forms a new amide bond with the nucleophilic amino group of the Gly(5) 
      portion of branched Lipid II, anchoring the protein to this key intermediate that is 
      subsequently polymerized into peptidoglycan. Here we describe the development of a 
      general in vitro method for elucidating the substrate specificity of sortase 
      enzymes. In addition, using immunofluorescence, cell adhesion assays, and 
      transmission electron microscopy, we establish links between in vitro substrate 
      specificity and in vivo function of the S. aureus sortase isoforms. Results from 
      these studies provide strong supporting evidence of a primary role of the SrtA 
      isoform in S. aureus adhesion and host colonization, illustrate a lack of 
      specificity cross talk between SrtA and SrtB isoforms, and highlight the potential 
      of SrtA as a target for the development of antivirulence chemotherapeutics against 
      Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.

TI  - Role of Sortase A in Lactobacillus gasseri Kx110A1 Adhesion to Gastric Epithelial

AB  - We have previously shown that Lactobacillus gasseri Kx110A1, a human stomach 
      isolate, can colonize mouse stomach and reduce the initial colonization of 
      Helicobacter pylori. Here, we investigated the role of sortase-dependent proteins 
      (SDPs) involved in these functions by the construction of a mutant for srtA, the 
      gene encoding the housekeeping sortase that covalently anchors SDPs to the cell 
      surface. The srtA mutant showed a decrease in hydrophobicity and autoaggregation 
      under acidic conditions, indicating the effect of SDPs on cell surface properties. 
      Correspondingly, the srtA mutant lost the capacity to adhere to gastric epithelial 
      cells, thus resulting in an inability to provide a physical barrier to prevent H. 
      pylori adherence. These results indicate that sortase A is a key determinant of the 
      cell surface properties of L. gasseri Kx110A1 and contributes to 
      Lactobacillus-mediated exclusion of H. pylori. Understanding the molecular 
      mechanisms by which lactobacilli antagonize H. pylori might contribute to the 
      development of novel therapeutic strategies that take advantage of health-promoting 
      bacteria and reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance.

TI  - Dual display of proteins on the yeast cell surface simplifies quantification of 
      binding interactions and enzymatic bioconjugation reactions.
LID - 10.1002/biot.201600696 [doi]
AB  - Yeast surface display, a well-established technology for protein analysis and 
      engineering, involves expressing a protein of interest as a genetic fusion to either 
      the N- or C-terminus of the yeast Aga2p mating protein. Historically, 
      yeast-displayed protein variants are flanked by peptide epitope tags that enable 
      flow cytometric measurement of construct expression using fluorescent primary or 
      secondary antibodies. Here, we built upon this technology to develop a new yeast 
      display strategy that comprises fusion of two different proteins to Aga2p, one to 
      the N-terminus and one to the C-terminus. This approach allows an antibody fragment, 
      ligand, or receptor to be directly coupled to expression of a fluorescent protein 
      readout, eliminating the need for antibody-staining of epitope tags to quantify 
      yeast protein expression levels. We show that this system simplifies quantification 
      of protein-protein binding interactions measured on the yeast cell surface. 
      Moreover, we show that this system facilitates co-expression of a bioconjugation 
      enzyme and its corresponding peptide substrate on the same Aga2p construct, enabling 
      enzyme expression and catalytic activity to be measured on the surface of yeast.

AB  - Signal peptide-driven secretion of precursor proteins directs polypeptides across 
      the plasma membrane of bacteria. Two pathways, Sec- and SRP-dependent, converge at 
      the SecYEG translocon to thread unfolded precursor proteins across the membrane, 
      whereas folded preproteins are routed via the Tat secretion pathway. Gram-positive 
      bacteria lack an outer membrane and are surrounded by a rigid layer of 
      peptidoglycan. Interactions with their environment are mediated by proteins that are 
      retained in the cell wall, often through covalent attachment to the peptidoglycan. 
      In this review, we describe the mechanisms for both Sec-dependent secretion and 
      sortase-dependent assembly of proteins in the envelope of Gram-positive bacteria. 
      This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Protein trafficking and secretion 
      in bacteria. Guest Editors: Anastassios Economou and Ross Dalbey.

TI  - Acyl enzyme intermediates in sortase-catalyzed pilus morphogenesis in gram-positive 
      bacteria.
PG  - 5603-12
LID - 10.1128/JB.00627-09 [doi]
AB  - In gram-positive bacteria, covalently linked pilus polymers are assembled by a 
      specific transpeptidase enzyme called pilus-specific sortase. This sortase is 
      postulated to cleave the LPXTG motif of a pilin precursor between threonine and 
      glycine and to form an acyl enzyme intermediate with the substrate. Pilus 
      polymerization is believed to occur through the resolution of this intermediate upon 
      specific nucleophilic attack by the conserved lysine located within the pilin motif 
      of another pilin monomer, which joins two pilins with an isopeptide bond formed 
      between threonine and lysine. Here, we present evidence for sortase reaction 
      intermediates in Corynebacterium diphtheriae. We show that truncated SrtA mutants 
      that are loosely bound to the cytoplasmic membrane form high-molecular-weight 
      complexes with SpaA polymers secreted into the extracellular milieu. These complexes 
      are not formed with SpaA pilin mutants that have alanine substitutions in place of 
      threonine in the LPXTG motif or lysine in the pilin motif. The same phenotype is 
      observed with alanine substitutions of either the conserved cysteine or histidine 
      residue of SrtA known to be required for catalysis. Remarkably, the assembly of SpaA 
      pili, or the formation of intermediates, is abolished with a SrtA mutant missing the 
      membrane-anchoring domain. We infer that pilus polymerization involves the formation 
      of covalent pilin-sortase intermediates, which occurs within a molecular platform on 
      the exoplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane that brings together both sortase 
      and its cognate substrates in close proximity to each other, likely surrounding a 
      secretion apparatus. We present electron microscopic data in support of this 
      picture.

TI  - Identification of novel genomic islands coding for antigenic pilus-like structures 
      in Streptococcus agalactiae.
PG  - 126-41
AB  - We have recently reported the presence of covalently linked pilus-like structures in 
      the human pathogen, Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The pilus operon codes for three 
      proteins which contain the conserved amino acid motif, LPXTG, associated with cell 
      wall-anchored proteins together with two genes coding for sortase enzymes. Analysis 
      of the eight sequenced genomes of GBS has led to the identification of a second, 
      related genomic island of which there are two variants, each containing genes coding 
      for proteins with LPXTG motifs and sortases. Here we show that both variant islands 
      also code for pilus-like structures. Furthermore, we provide a thorough description 
      and characterization of the genomic organization of the islands and the role of each 
      protein in the assembly of the pili. For each pilus, polymerization of one of the 
      three component proteins is essential for incorporation of the other two proteins 
      into the pilus structure. In addition, two sortases are required for complete pilus 
      assembly, each with specificity for one of the pilus components. A component protein 
      of one of the newly identified pili is also a previously identified protective 
      antigen and a second component of this pilus is shown to confer protection against 
      GBS challenge. We propose that pilus-like structures are important virulence factors 
      and potential vaccine candidates.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms of the sortase A gene and social-behavioural factors 
      associated with caries in children: a case-control study.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1186/s12903-015-0039-1 [doi]
LID - 54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is the primary etiological agent of 
      dental caries. Sortase is a transpeptidase that anchors several surface proteins to 
      the S. mutans cell wall and has been shown to play a major role in cariogenicity. 
      The purpose of this study was to explore the genetic polymorphisms of the sortase 
      gene (srtA) and the social-behavioural factors associated with dental caries in 
      children with S. mutans. METHODS: In this case-control study, 121 S. mutans strains 
      were separately selected from caries-free children and high-severity caries children 
      for sequencing of the srtA gene. Social and behavioural data were collected by 
      self-administered questionnaires. Genomic DNA was extracted from S. mutans strains 
      and amplified by PCR to obtain the srtA gene. The purified PCR products were 
      sequenced and analysed for mutations with ABI Variant Reporter software. The 
      distribution of missense mutations and the mean of social-behavioural factors were 
      compared between the groups. A multiple logistic regression model was used to 
      control for confounding factors. RESULTS: The mutation frequencies at loci 168 (P = 
      0.023) and 470 (P = 0.032) were significantly different between the groups. The 
      best-fitting model showed that greater age, high frequencies of solid sugar 
      consumption, prolonged breastfeeding, a high proportion of visible plaque, and S. 
      mutans with a T at locus 168 of the srtA gene were associated with high-severity 
      caries in children (P < 0.05). Children carrying a G at locus 168 of S. mutans had a 
      decreased risk for high-severity caries (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12-0.86) compared 
      with those carrying a T. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that the locus 168 
      missense mutation of the srtA gene may correlate with caries susceptibility in 
      children with S. mutans. In addition, age, duration of breastfeeding, solid sugar 
      consumption, and poor oral hygiene contributed to this complex disease.

AB  - Staphylococcus haemolyticus is the second most frequently isolated CoNS from ocular 
      infections and human blood cultures. In this study, we examined 18 ocular S. 
      haemolyticus isolates for their capacity to form biofilm and conducted detachment 
      assay to determine the composition of the biofilm matrix and involvement of various 
      elements in cell lysis. PCR identified the presence of biofilm-associated genes, and 
      ica operon and CLSM visualized the components of the biofilm matrix. We found that 
      PIA-independent biofilm formation is the characteristic feature of S. haemolyticus 
      isolates, irrespective of the sources of isolation, and protein or DNA or both are 
      the major components of the biofilm matrix. Cell lysis enabling DNA release was an 
      essential step for biofilm attachment during the initial stages of biofilm 
      development. The srtA transcript expression study indicates its role in the early 
      stages of biofilm development. We found the presence of antibiotic resistance genes 
      in the eDNA and gDNA thus suggesting the possible role of biofilm in horizontal gene 
      transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants. The overall study indicates that S. 
      haemolyticus formed the biofilm comprising of protein or DNA or both and srtA play a 
      role in the initial development of biofilm.

TI  - Nanobody-Engineered Natural Killer Cell Conjugates for Solid Tumor Adoptive 
      Immunotherapy.
PG  - e2103463
LID - 10.1002/smll.202103463 [doi]
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy based on natural killer (NK) cells is demonstrated to be a 
      promising strategy. However, NK cells are deficient in ligands that target specific 
      tumors, resulting in limited antitumor efficacy. Here, a glycoengineering approach 
      to imitate the chimeric antigen receptor strategy and decorate NK cells with 
      nanobodies to promote NK-based immunotherapy in solid tumors is proposed. Nanobody 
      7D12, which specifically recognizes the human epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR) that is overexpressed on many solid tumors, is coupled to the chemically 
      synthesized DBCO-PEG(4) -GGG-NH(2) by sortase A-mediated ligation to generate 
      DBCO-7D12. The NK92MI cells bearing azide groups are then equipped with DBCO-7D12 
      via bioorthogonal click chemistry. The resultant 7D12-NK92MI cells exhibit high 
      specificity and affinity for EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo by 
      the 7D12-EGFR interaction, causing increased cytokine secretion to more effectively 
      kill EGFR-positive tumor cells, but not EGFR-negative cancer cells. Importantly, the 
      7D12-NK92MI cells also show a wide anticancer spectrum and extensive tumor 
      penetration. Furthermore, mouse experiments reveal that 7D12-NK92MI treatment 
      achieves excellent therapeutic efficacy and outstanding safety. The authors' works 
      provide a cell modification strategy using specific protein ligands without genetic 
      manipulation and present a potential novel method for cancer-targeted immunotherapy 
      by NK cells.

TI  - A Modular Vaccine Development Platform Based on Sortase-Mediated Site-Specific 
      Tagging of Antigens onto Virus-Like Particles.
PG  - 25741

AB  - Virus-like particles (VLPs) can be used as powerful nanoscale weapons to fight 
      against virus infection. In addition to direct use as vaccines, VLPs have been 
      extensively exploited as platforms on which to display foreign antigens for 
      prophylactic vaccination and immunotherapeutic treatment. Unfortunately, fabrication 
      of new chimeric VLP vaccines in a versatile, site-specific and highly efficient 
      manner is beyond the capability of traditional VLP vaccine design approaches, 
      genetic insertion and chemical conjugation. In this study, we described a greatly 
      improved VLP display strategy by chemoenzymatic site-specific tailoring antigens on 
      VLPs surface with high efficiency. Through the transpeptidation mediated by sortase 
      A, one protein and two epitopes containing N-terminal oligoglycine were conjugated 
      to the LPET motif on the surface of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) VLPs with 
      high density. All of the new chimeric VLPs induced strong specific IgG responses. 
      Furthermore, the chimeric VLPs with sortase A tagged enterovirus 71 (EV71) SP70 
      epitope could elicit effective antibodies against EV71 lethal challenging as well as 
      the genetic insertion chimeric VLPs. The sortase A mediated chemoenzymatic 
      site-specific tailoring of the HBc VLP approach shows great potential in new VLP 
      vaccine design for its simplicity, site specificity, high efficiency, and 
      versatility.

TI  - Internalization of Influenza Virus and Cell Surface Proteins Monitored by 
      Site-Specific Conjugation of Protease-Sensitive Probes.
PG  - 1836-1844
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.9b00493 [doi]
AB  - Commonly used methods to monitor internalization of cell surface structures involve 
      application of fluorescently or otherwise labeled antibodies against the target of 
      interest. Genetic modification of the protein of interest, for example through 
      creation of fusions with fluorescent or enzymatically active protein domains, is 
      another approach to follow trafficking behavior. The former approach requires 
      indirect methods, such as multiple rounds of cell staining, to distinguish between a 
      target that remains surface-disposed and an internalized and/or recycled species. 
      The latter approach necessitates the creation of fusions whose behavior may not 
      accurately reflect that of their unmodified counterparts. Here, we report a method 
      for the characterization of protein internalization in real time through 
      sortase-mediated, site-specific labeling of single-domain antibodies or viral 
      proteins with a newly developed, cathepsin-sensitive quenched-fluorophore probe. 
      Quenched probes of this type have been used to measure enzyme activity in complex 
      environments and for different cell types, but not as a sensor of protein movement 
      into living cells. This approach allows a quantitative assessment of the movement of 
      proteins into protease-containing endosomes in real time in living cells. We 
      demonstrate considerable variation in the rate of endosomal delivery for different 
      cell surface receptors. We were also able to characterize the kinetics of influenza 
      virus delivery to cathepsin-positive compartments, showing highly coordinated 
      arrival in endosomal compartments. This approach should be useful for identifying 
      proteins expressed on cells of interest for targeted endosomal delivery of payloads, 
      such as antibody-drug conjugates or antigens that require processing.

TI  - Construction of Anti-HER2 Recombinants as Targeting Modules for a Drug-delivery 
      System Against HER2-positive Cells.
PG  - 4319-4325
LID - 10.21873/anticanres.12731 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Recombinant antibodies have been investigated and used in 
      applications such as targeting modules of drug-delivery systems (DDS) against 
      cancers. This study aimed to prepare recombinant antibodies against HER2, containing 
      sortase A (SrtA) recognition sequence, that are applicable as targeting modules in 
      DDS after linkage with the drug-carrier containing oligoglycine-acceptor peptide by 
      SrtA transpeptidation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The recombinant trastuzumab fragment 
      antibodies (scFvs and Fab) with the SrtA-recognition motif (LPXTG) at their 
      C-terminal were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli and Chinese hamster 
      ovary (CHO) cells, respectively. The reactivity of the purified recombinant 
      antibodies towards HER2-expressing cells was also evaluated via immunofluorescent 
      staining. RESULTS: Fab demonstrated higher yield and purity and better reactivity 
      towards HER2-expressing cells (HCT-15 and HeLa) when compared to scFvs. CONCLUSION: 
      The CHO expression system possesses superior yield and purity when compared to the 
      E. coli expression system with respect to the preparation of recombinant antibodies 
      applicable in targeting modules for DDS (DDS-TM). Moreover, a Fab variant prepared 
      in this study demonstrated the potential to be a DDS-TM against HER2-expressing 
      cancer cells.

TI  - Logic-Based Delivery of Site-Specifically Modified Proteins from Environmentally 
      Responsive Hydrogel Biomaterials.
PG  - e1902462
LID - 10.1002/adma.201902462 [doi]
AB  - The controlled presentation of proteins from and within materials remains of 
      significant interest for many bioengineering applications. Though "smart" platforms 
      offer control over protein release in response to a single external cue, no strategy 
      has been developed to trigger delivery in response to user-specified combinations of 
      environmental inputs, nor to independently control the release of multiple species 
      from a homogenous material. Here, a modular semisynthetic scheme is introduced to 
      govern the release of site-specifically modified proteins from hydrogels following 
      Boolean logic. A sortase-mediated transpeptidation reaction is used to generate 
      recombinant proteins C-terminally tethered to gels through environmentally sensitive 
      degradable linkers. By varying the connectivity of multiple stimuli-labile moieties 
      within these customizable linkers, YES/OR/AND control of protein release is 
      exhaustively demonstrated in response to one and two-input combinations involving 
      enzyme, reductant, and light. Tethering of multiple proteins each through a 
      different stimuli-sensitive linker permits their independent and sequential release 
      from a common material. It is expected that these methodologies will enable new 
      opportunities in tissue engineering and therapeutic delivery.

TI  - The Streptococcos suis sortases SrtB and SrtF are essential for disease in pigs.
PG  - 163-173
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000752 [doi]
AB  - The porcine pathogen Streptococcus suis colonizes the upper respiratory tracts of 
      pigs, potentially causing septicaemia, meningitis and death, thus placing a severe 
      burden on the agricultural industry worldwide. It is also a zoonotic pathogen that 
      is known to cause systemic infections and meningitis in humans. Understanding how S. 
      suis colonizes and interacts with its hosts is relevant for future strategies of 
      drug and vaccine development. As with other Gram-positive bacteria, S. suis utilizes 
      enzymes known as sortases to attach specific proteins bearing cell wall sorting 
      signals to its surface, where they can play a role in host-pathogen interactions. 
      The surface proteins of bacteria are often important in adhesion to and invasion of 
      host cells. In this study, markerless in-frame deletion mutants of the housekeeping 
      sortase srtA and the two pilus-associated sortases, srtB and srtF, were generated 
      and their importance in S. suis infections was investigated. We found that all three 
      of these sortases are essential to disease in pigs, concluding that their 
      cognate-sorted proteins may also be useful in protecting pigs against infection.

TI  - Protein secretion and surface display in Gram-positive bacteria.
PG  - 1123-39
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2011.0210 [doi]
AB  - The cell wall peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria functions as a surface 
      organelle for the transport and assembly of proteins that interact with the 
      environment, in particular, the tissues of an infected host. Signal peptide-bearing 
      precursor proteins are secreted across the plasma membrane of Gram-positive 
      bacteria. Some precursors carry C-terminal sorting signals with unique sequence 
      motifs that are cleaved by sortase enzymes and linked to the cell wall peptidoglycan 
      of vegetative forms or spores. The sorting signals of pilin precursors are cleaved 
      by pilus-specific sortases, which generate covalent bonds between proteins leading 
      to the assembly of fimbrial structures. Other precursors harbour surface (S)-layer 
      homology domains (SLH), which fold into a three-pronged spindle structure and bind 
      secondary cell wall polysaccharides, thereby associating with the surface of 
      specific Gram-positive microbes. Type VII secretion is a non-canonical secretion 
      pathway for WXG100 family proteins in mycobacteria. Gram-positive bacteria also 
      secrete WXG100 proteins and carry unique genes that either contribute to discrete 
      steps in secretion or represent distinctive substrates for protein transport 
      reactions.

TI  - Development of a high-performance liquid chromatography assay and revision of 
      kinetic parameters for the Staphylococcus aureus sortase transpeptidase SrtA.
PG  - 42-8
AB  - The SrtA isoform of the Staphylococcus aureus sortase transpeptidase is responsible 
      for the covalent attachment of virulence- and colonization-associated proteins to 
      the bacterial peptidoglycan. Sortase utilizes two substrates, 
      undecaprenol-pyrophosphoryl-MurNAc(GlcNAc)-Ala-d-isoGlu-Lys(-Gly5)-d-Ala-d-Ala 
      (branched Lipid II) and secreted proteins containing a highly conserved LPXTG 
      sequence near their C termini. SrtA simultaneously cleaves the Thr-Gly bond of the 
      LPXTG-containing protein and forms a new amide bond with the nucleophilic amino 
      group of the Gly5 portion of branched Lipid II, anchoring the protein to this key 
      intermediate that is subsequently polymerized into peptidoglycan. Here we show that 
      reported fluorescence quenching activity assays for SrtA are subject to marked 
      fluorescence inner filter effect quenching, resulting in prematurely hyperbolic 
      velocity versus substrate profiles and underestimates of the true kinetic parameters 
      kcat and Km. We therefore devised a discontinuous high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC)-based assay to monitor the SrtA reaction employing the same 
      substrates used in the fluorescence quenching assay: Gly5 and 
      Abz-LPETG-Dap(Dnp)-NH2. Fluorescence or UV detection using these substrates 
      facilitates separate analysis of both the acylation and the transpeptidation steps 
      of the reaction. Because HPLC was performed using fast-flow analytical columns 
      (<8min/run), high-throughput applications of this assay for analysis of SrtA 
      substrate specificity, kinetic mechanism, and inhibition are now feasible. Kinetic 
      analysis using the HPLC assay revealed that the kinetic parameters for SrtA with 
      Abz-LPETG-Dap(Dnp)-NH2 are 5.5mM for Km and 0.27s-1 for kcat. The Km for Gly5 was 
      determined to be 140microM. These values represent a 300-fold increase in Km for the 
      LPXTG substrate and a 12,000-fold increase in kcat over literature-reported values, 
      suggesting that SrtA is more a robust enzyme than previous analyses indicated.

TI  - Phenotypic, proteomic, and genomic characterization of a putative ABC-transporter 
      permease involved in Listeria monocytogenes biofilm formation.
PG  - 495-501
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2010.0697 [doi]
AB  - The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is able to form biofilms in food 
      processing environments. Previously, we have reported that an lm.G_1771 gene 
      (encoding a putative ABC-transporter permease) was involved in negative regulation 
      of L. monocytogenes biofilm formation using LM-49, a biofilm-enhanced mutant 
      isolated on Tn917 mutagenesis (AEM 2008 p.7675-7683). Here, the possible action of 
      this ABC-transporter permease in L. monocytogenes biofilm formation was 
      characterized by phenotypic, proteomic, and genomic analyses using an lm.G_1771 gene 
      deletant (Δ1771). The Δ1771 mutant exhibited the same enhanced ability for biofilm 
      formation as the LM-49 strain using a crystal violet staining assay. DNA microarrays 
      and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed 49 and 11 differentially expressed 
      (twofold or more) genes or proteins in Δ1771, respectively. The transcriptomics 
      study indicated that lm.G_1771 could play a vital role in regulating candidate genes 
      involved in biofilm formation such as genes encoding cell surface proteins (Dlt), 
      cell surface anchor proteins (SrtA), and transcriptional regulators (GntR) 
      contributing to negative regulation of biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes. The 
      mutant Δ1771 was more sensitive to Triton X-100 and less resistant to cationic 
      antibiotics, which might be explained by the down-regulation of dlt operon in this 
      deletant and the fact that dlt involves the incorporation of D-alanine residues into 
      lipoteichoic acids, resulting in a positive net charge on the teichoic acids. 
      Therefore, lm.G_1771 is considered to be involved in negative regulation of biofilm 
      formation, and the results from this work provide a possible molecular mechanism of 
      biofilm formation regulated by lm.G_1771 in L. monocytogenes.

TI  - Contribution of sortase SrtA2 to Lactobacillus casei BL23 inhibition of 
      Staphylococcus aureus internalization into bovine mammary epithelial cells.
PG  - e0174060
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0174060 [doi]
LID - e0174060
AB  - Probiotics have been considered as a promising strategy to prevent various diseases 
      in both humans and animals. This approach has gained interest in recent years as a 
      potential means to control bovine mastitis. In a previous study, we found that 
      several L. casei strains, including BL23, were able to inhibit the internalization 
      of S. aureus, a major etiologic agent of mastitis, into bovine mammary epithelial 
      cells (bMEC). This antagonism required a direct contact between L. casei and bMEC or 
      S. aureus, suggesting the inhibition relied on interactions between L. casei cell 
      surface components and bMEC. In this study, we have investigated the impact of some 
      candidates which likely influence bacteria host cell interactions. We have shown 
      that L. casei BL23 fbpA retained its inhibitory potential, indicating that L. casei 
      BL23 antagonism did not rely (solely) on competition between S. aureus and L. casei 
      fibronectin-binding proteins for adhesion to bMEC. We have then investigated the 
      impact of four sortase mutants, srtA1, srtA2, srtC1 and srtC2, and a double mutant 
      (srtA1-srtA2) on L. casei BL23 inhibitory potential. Sortases are responsible for 
      the anchoring on the bacterial cell wall of LPXTG-proteins, which reportedly play an 
      important role in bacteria-host cell interaction. All the srt mutants tested 
      presented a reduced inhibition capacity, the most pronounced effect being observed 
      with the srtA2 mutant. A lower internalization capacity of L. casei srtA2 into bMEC 
      was also observed. This was associated with several changes at the surface of L. 
      casei BL23 srtA2 compared to the wild type (wt) strain, including altered abundance 
      of some LPXTG- and moonlighting proteins, and modifications of cell wall structure. 
      These results strongly support the role of sortase A2 in L. casei BL23 inhibition 
      against S. aureus internalization. Deciphering the contribution of the cell surface 
      components altered in srtA2 strain in the inhibition will require further 
      investigation.

TI  - Development of a method for markerless genetic exchange in Enterococcus faecalis and 
      its use in construction of a srtA mutant.
PG  - 5837-49
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive commensal bacterium of the gastrointestinal 
      tract and an important opportunistic pathogen. Despite the increasing clinical 
      significance of the enterococci, genetic analysis of these organisms has thus far 
      been limited in scope due to the lack of advanced genetic tools. To broaden the 
      repertoire of genetic tools available for manipulation of E.faecalis, we 
      investigated the use of phosphoribosyl transferases as elements of a 
      counterselection strategy. We report here the development of a counterselectable 
      markerless genetic exchange system based on the upp-encoded uracil phosphoribosyl 
      transferase of E. faecalis. Whereas wild-type E. faecalis is sensitive to growth 
      inhibition by the toxic base analog 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a mutant bearing an 
      in-frame deletion of upp is resistant to 5-FU. When a cloned version of upp was 
      ectopically introduced into the deletion mutant, sensitivity to 5-FU growth 
      inhibition was restored, thereby providing the basis for a two-step integration and 
      excision strategy for the transfer of mutant alleles to the enterococcal chromosome 
      by recombination. This method was validated by the construction of a DeltasrtA 
      mutant of E. faecalis and by the exchange of the surface protein Asc10, encoded on 
      the pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pCF10, with a previously isolated 
      mutant allele. Analysis of the DeltasrtA mutant indicated that SrtA anchors Asc10 to 
      the enterococcal cell wall, facilitating the pheromone-induced aggregation of E. 
      faecalis cells required for high-frequency conjugative plasmid transfer in liquid 
      matings. The system of markerless exchange reported here will facilitate detailed 
      genetic analysis of these important pathogens.

TI  - Protein Labeling via a Specific Lysine-Isopeptide Bond Using the Pilin Polymerizing 
      Sortase from Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

AB  - Proteins that are site-specifically modified with peptides and chemicals can be used 
      as novel therapeutics, imaging tools, diagnostic reagents and materials. However, 
      there are few enzyme-catalyzed methods currently available to selectively conjugate 
      peptides to internal sites within proteins. Here we show that a pilus-specific 
      sortase enzyme from Corynebacterium diphtheriae ((Cd)SrtA) can be used to attach a 
      peptide to a protein via a specific lysine-isopeptide bond. Using rational 
      mutagenesis we created (Cd)SrtA(3M), a highly activated cysteine transpeptidase that 
      catalyzes in vitro isopeptide bond formation. (Cd)SrtA(3M) mediates bioconjugation 
      to a specific lysine residue within a fused domain derived from the corynebacterial 
      SpaA protein. Peptide modification yields greater than >95% can be achieved. We 
      demonstrate that (Cd)SrtA(3M) can be used in concert with the Staphylococcus aureus 
      SrtA enzyme, enabling dual, orthogonal protein labeling via lysine-isopeptide and 
      backbone-peptide bonds.

TI  - Structural differences between the Streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and 
      pilus-specific sortases: SrtA and SrtC1.
PG  - e22995
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0022995 [doi]
LID - e22995
AB  - The assembly of pili on the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria requires 
      transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. In Streptococcus agalactiae, the PI-1 pilus 
      island of strain 2603V/R encodes two pilus-specific sortases (SrtC1 and SrtC2) and 
      three pilins (GBS80, GBS52 and GBS104). Although either pilus-specific sortase is 
      sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, GBS80, incorporation of the 
      minor pilins GBS52 and GBS104 into the pilus structure requires SrtC1 and SrtC2, 
      respectively. The S. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, SrtA, whose gene is present at 
      a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be 
      involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. To understand the structural 
      basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal 
      structures of S. agalactiae SrtC1 and SrtA. Both enzymes are made of an 
      eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. 
      SrtA exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in Streptococcus 
      pyogenes SrtA but different from that in Staphylococcus aureus SrtA. In contrast, 
      the SrtC1 enzyme contains an N-terminal helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative 
      active site, which is similar to that seen in Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and 
      composition. To understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, 
      we have also determined the crystal structure of a SrtC1 mutant, in which the 
      conserved DP(W/F/Y) motif was replaced with the sorting signal motif of GBS80, 
      IPNTG. By comparing the structures of WT wild type SrtA and SrtC1 and the 'lid' 
      mutant of SrtC1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the 
      lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.

AB  - Enzyme-mediated protein modification often requires large amounts of biocatalyst, 
      adding significant costs to the process and limiting industrial applications. 
      Herein, we demonstrate a scalable and straightforward strategy for the efficient 
      capture and recycling of enzymes using a small-molecule affinity tag. A proline 
      variant of an evolved sortase A (SrtA 7M) was N-terminally labeled with lithocholic 
      acid (LA)-an inexpensive bile acid that exhibits strong binding to β-cyclodextrin 
      (βCD). Capture and recycling of the LA-Pro-SrtA 7M conjugate was achieved using 
      βCD-modified sepharose resin. The LA-Pro-SrtA 7M conjugate retained full enzymatic 
      activity, even after multiple rounds of recycling.

TI  - Covalent attachment of proteins to solid supports and surfaces via Sortase-mediated 
      ligation.
PG  - e1164
LID - e1164
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the attachment of proteins to solid 
      supports for the development of supported catalysts, affinity matrices, and micro 
      devices as well as for the development of planar and bead based protein arrays for 
      multiplexed assays of protein concentration, interactions, and activity. A critical 
      requirement for these applications is the generation of a stable linkage between the 
      solid support and the immobilized, but still functional, protein. METHODOLOGY: Solid 
      supports including crosslinked polymer beads, beaded agarose, and planar glass 
      surfaces, were modified to present an oligoglycine motif to solution. A range of 
      proteins were ligated to the various surfaces using the Sortase A enzyme of S. 
      aureus. Reactions were carried out in aqueous buffer conditions at room temperature 
      for times between one and twelve hours. CONCLUSIONS: The Sortase A transpeptidase of 
      S. aureus provides a general, robust, and gentle approach to the selective covalent 
      immobilization of proteins on three very different solid supports. The proteins 
      remain functional and accessible to solution. Sortase mediated ligation is therefore 
      a straightforward methodology for the preparation of solid supported enzymes and 
      bead based assays, as well as the modification of planar surfaces for 
      microanalytical devices and protein arrays.

TI  - The fast milk acidifying phenotype of Streptococcus thermophilus can be acquired by 
      natural transformation of the genomic island encoding the cell-envelope proteinase 
      PrtS.
PG  - S21
LID - 10.1186/1475-2859-10-S1-S21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In industrial fermentation processes, the rate of milk acidification by 
      Streptococcus thermophilus is of major technological importance. The cell-envelope 
      proteinase PrtS was previously shown to be a key determinant of the milk 
      acidification activity in this species. The PrtS enzyme is tightly anchored to the 
      cell wall via a mechanism involving the typical sortase A (SrtA) and initiates the 
      breakdown of milk casein into small oligopeptides. The presence or absence of PrtS 
      divides the S. thermophilus strains into two phenotypic groups i.e. the slow and the 
      fast acidifying strains. The aim of this study was to improve the milk acidification 
      rate of slow S. thermophilus strains, and hence optimise the fermentation process of 
      dairy products. RESULTS: In the present work, we developed for the first time a 
      strategy based on natural transformation to confer the rapid acidification phenotype 
      to slow acidifying starter strains of S. thermophilus. First, we established by gene 
      disruption that (i) prtS, encoding the cell-envelope proteinase, is a key factor 
      responsible for rapid milk acidification in fast acidifying strains, and that (ii) 
      srtA, encoding sortase A, is not absolutely required to express the PrtS activity. 
      Second, a 15-kb PCR product encompassing the prtS genomic island was transferred by 
      natural transformation using the competence-inducing peptide in three distinct 
      prtS-defective genetic backgrounds having or not a truncated sortase A gene. We 
      showed that in all cases the milk acidification rate of transformants was 
      significantly increased, reaching a level similar to that of wild-type fast 
      acidifying strains. Furthermore, it appeared that the prtS-encoded activity does not 
      depend on the prtS copy number or on its chromosomal integration locus. CONCLUSION: 
      We have successfully used natural competence to transfer the prtS locus encoding the 
      cell-envelope proteinase in three slow acidifying strains of S. thermophilus, 
      allowing their conversion into fast acidifying derivatives. The efficient protocol 
      developed in this article will provide the dairy industry with novel and optimised 
      S. thermophilus starter strains.

TI  - Development of Potent and Selective S. aureus Sortase A Inhibitors Based on Peptide 
      Macrocycles.
PG  - 606-11
LID - 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.6b00045 [doi]
AB  - Sortases are transpeptidase enzymes that anchor surface proteins, including 
      virulence factors, to the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and they are 
      potential targets for the development of anti-infective agents. While several large 
      compound libraries were searched by high-throughput screening, no high-affinity 
      inhibitors of sortases could be developed to date. Here, we applied phage display to 
      screen billions of peptide macrocycles against sortase A (SrtA) of Staphylococcus 
      aureus (S. aureus). We were able to identify potent and selective inhibitors of SrtA 
      that blocked SrtA-mediated anchoring of synthetic substrates to the surface of live 
      S. aureus cells. A region present in all inhibitory peptides (Leu-Pro-Pro) resembled 
      the natural substrates of SrtA (Leu-Pro-Xaa-Thr-Gly), suggesting that the 
      macrocycles bind to the enzyme's active site and that they form similar molecular 
      contacts as natural substrates. The evolved peptide macrocycles may be used as lead 
      structures for the development of potent peptidomimetic SrtA inhibitors.

TI  - Mn2+-dependent regulation of multiple genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae through PsaR 
      and the resultant impact on virulence.
PG  - 1171-80
AB  - The concentration of Mn2+ is 1,000-fold higher in secretions than it is at internal 
      sites of the body, making it a potential signal by which bacteria can sense a shift 
      from a mucosal environment to a more invasive site. PsaR, a metal-dependent 
      regulator in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was found to negatively affect the 
      transcription of psaBCA, pcpA, rrgA, rrgB, rrgC, srtBCD, and rlrA in the presence of 
      Mn2+. psaBCA encode an ABC-type transporter for Mn2+. pcpA, rrgA, rrgB, and rrgC 
      encode several outer surface proteins. srtBCD encode a cluster of sortase enzymes, 
      and rlrA encodes a transcriptional regulator. Steady-state RNA levels are high under 
      low Mn2+ concentrations in the wild-type strain and are elevated under both high and 
      low Mn2+ concentrations in a psaR mutant strain. RlrA is an activator of rrgA, rrgB, 
      rrgC, and srtBCD (D. Hava and A. Camilli, Mol. Microbiol. 45:1389-1406, 2002), 
      suggesting that PsaR may indirectly control these genes through rlrA, while 
      PsaR-dependent repression of psaBCA, pcpA, and rlrA transcription is direct. The 
      impact of Mn2+-dependent regulation on virulence was further examined in mouse 
      models of pneumonia and nasopharyngeal carriage. The abilities of DeltapsaR, pcpA, 
      and DeltapsaR DeltapcpA mutant strains to colonize the lung were reduced compared to 
      those of the wild type, confirming that both PcpA-mediated gene regulation and 
      PsaR-mediated gene regulation are required for full virulence in the establishment 
      of pneumonia. Neither PcpA nor PsaR was found to be required for colonization of the 
      nasopharynx in a carriage model. This is the first demonstration of Mn2+ acting as a 
      signal for the expression of virulence factors within different host sites.

TI  - Structures of sortase B from Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis reveal 
      catalytic amino acid triad in the active site.
PG  - 1147-56
AB  - Surface proteins attached by sortases to the cell wall envelope of bacterial 
      pathogens play important roles during infection. Sorting and attachment of these 
      proteins is directed by C-terminal signals. Sortase B of S. aureus recognizes a 
      motif NPQTN, cleaves the polypeptide after the Thr residue, and attaches the protein 
      to pentaglycine cross-bridges. Sortase B of B. anthracis is thought to recognize the 
      NPKTG motif, and attaches surface proteins to m-diaminopimelic acid cross-bridges. 
      We have determined crystal structure of sortase B from B. anthracis and S. aureus at 
      1.6 and 2.0 A resolutions, respectively. These structures show a beta-barrel fold 
      with alpha-helical elements on its outside, a structure thus far exclusive to the 
      sortase family. A putative active site located on the edge of the beta-barrel is 
      comprised of a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad and presumably faces the bacterial cell 
      surface. A putative binding site for the sorting signal is located nearby.

LID - 10.3390/pathogens10121540 [doi]
LID - 1540
AB  - Dental caries, as a common oral infectious disease, is a worldwide public health 
      issue. Oral biofilms are the main cause of dental caries. Streptococcus mutans (S. 
      mutans) is well recognized as the major causative factor of dental caries within 
      oral biofilms. In addition to mechanical removal such as tooth brushing and 
      flossing, the topical application of antimicrobial agents is necessarily adjuvant to 
      the control of caries particularly for high-risk populations. The mainstay 
      antimicrobial agents for caries such as chlorhexidine have limitations including 
      taste confusions, mucosal soreness, tooth discoloration, and disruption of an oral 
      microbial equilibrium. Antimicrobial small molecules are promising in the control of 
      S. mutans due to good antimicrobial activity, good selectivity, and low toxicity. In 
      this paper, we discussed the application of antimicrobial small molecules to the 
      control of S. mutans, with a particular focus on the identification and development 
      of active compounds and their modes of action against the growth and virulence of S. 
      mutans.

AB  - In this work, synthesis, antimicrobial activities and molecular docking studies of 
      some new series of substituted quinazolinone 2a-h and 3a-d were described. Starting 
      form 2-aminobenzamide derivatives 1, a new series of quinazolinone derivatives has 
      been synthesized, in high yields, assisted by microwave and classical methods. Some 
      of these substituted quinazolinones were tested for their antimicrobial activity 
      against Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Esherichia coli) and 
      Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis), and 
      anti-fungal activity against (Aspergillus fumigatus, Saccharomyces cervevisiae, and 
      Candida albicans) using agar well diffusion method. Among the prepared products, 
      3-benzyl-2-(4-chlorophenyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (3a) was found to exhibits the most 
      potent in vitro anti-microbial activity with MICs of 25.6±0.5, 24.3±0.4, 30.1±0.6, 
      and 25.1±0.5 µg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa and Esherichia coli, respectively. Compound 3a was found to exhibits the 
      most potent in vitro anti-fungal activity with MICs of 18.3±0.6, 23.1±0.4, and 
      26.1±0.5 µg/mL against Aspergillus fumigatus, Saccharomyces cervevisiae, and 
      Candidaal bicans, respectively.

AB  - Recent methods in DNA nanotechnology are enabling the creation of intricate 
      nanostructures through the use of programmable, bottom-up self-assembly. However, 
      structures consisting only of DNA are limited in their ability to act on other 
      biomolecules. Proteins, on the other hand, perform a variety of functions on 
      biological materials, but directed control of the self-assembly process remains a 
      challenge. While DNA-protein hybrids have the potential to provide the 
      best-of-both-worlds, they can be difficult to create as many of the conventional 
      techniques for linking proteins to DNA render proteins dysfunctional. We present 
      here a sortase-based protocol for covalently coupling proteins to DNA with minimal 
      disturbance to protein function. To accomplish this we have developed a two-step 
      process. First, a small synthetic peptide is bioorthogonally and covalently coupled 
      to a DNA oligo using click chemistry. Next, the DNA-peptide chimera is covalently 
      linked to a protein of interest under protein-compatible conditions using the enzyme 
      sortase. Our protocol allows for the simple coupling and purification of a 
      functional DNA-protein hybrid. We use this technique to form oligos bearing 
      cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15 protein fragments. Upon incorporation into a linear 
      M13 scaffold, these protein-DNA hybrids serve as the gate to a binary nanoswitch. 
      The outlined protocol is reliable and modular, facilitating the construction of 
      libraries of oligos and proteins that can be combined to form functional DNA-protein 
      nanostructures. These structures will enable a new class of functional 
      nanostructures, which could be used for therapeutic and industrial processes.

TI  - The svpA-srtB locus of Listeria monocytogenes: fur-mediated iron regulation and 
      effect on virulence.
PG  - 927-40
AB  - In Listeria monocytogenes the promoter region of the svpA-srtB locus contains a 
      well-conserved Fur box. We characterized the iron-regulation of this locus: 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses and anti-SvpA immunoblots showed that, 
      in response to iron deprivation svpA transcription and SvpA production markedly 
      increased (80-fold and 10-fold respectively), when initiated by either the addition 
      of the iron chelator 2,2'-bipyridyl to BHI media, or by growth in iron-restricted 
      minimal media. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs also showed 
      increased activity of the svpA-srtB promoter in Escherichia coli (37-fold) and in L. 
      monocytogenes (two- to threefold) when the bacteria were grown in iron-deficient 
      conditions. A Deltafur mutant of L. monocytogenes constitutively synthesized SvpA, 
      as well as GFP fused to the svpA-srtB promoter. Cellular fractionation data revealed 
      that in iron-rich media wild-type SvpA was exclusively secreted to the culture 
      supernatant. However, both the Deltafur derivative and wild-type L. monocytogenes 
      grown in iron-deficient media anchored a fraction of the SvpA proteins 
      (approximately 5%) to peptidoglycan, and produced a lower-molecular weight, wholly 
      secreted form of SvpA. Together these data establish that iron availability controls 
      transcription of the svpA-srtB locus (through Fur-mediated regulation), and 
      attachment of SvpA to the cell wall (through SrtB-mediated covalent linkage). SvpA 
      bears homology to IsdC, a haemin-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus, and 
      haemin bound to SvpA in solution. However, site-directed deletions of four 
      structural genes and the promoter of the svpA-srtB locus did not impair haemin, 
      haemoglobin or ferrichrome utilization in nutrition tests. We did not find strong 
      evidence to support the notion that the svpA-srtB locus participates in haemin 
      acquisition, as was reported for the homologous isd operon of S. aureus. 
      Furthermore, the svpA-srtB mutant strains showed no significant attenuation of 
      virulence in an intravenous mouse model system, but we found that the mutations 
      reduced the persistence of L. monocytogenes in murine liver, spleen and intestines 
      after oral administration.

TI  - Type VI secretion system sheaths as nanoparticles for antigen display.
PG  - 3042-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1524290113 [doi]
AB  - The bacterial type 6 secretion system (T6SS) is a dynamic apparatus that 
      translocates proteins between cells by a mechanism analogous to phage tail 
      contraction. T6SS sheaths are cytoplasmic tubular structures composed of stable 
      VipA-VipB (named for ClpV-interacting protein A and B) heterodimers. Here, the 
      structure of the VipA/B sheath was exploited to generate immunogenic multivalent 
      particles for vaccine delivery. Sheaths composed of VipB and VipA fused to an 
      antigen of interest were purified from Vibrio cholerae or Escherichia coli and used 
      for immunization. Sheaths displaying heterologous antigens generated better immune 
      responses against the antigen and different IgG subclasses compared with soluble 
      antigen alone. Moreover, antigen-specific antibodies raised against sheaths 
      presenting Neisseria meningitidis factor H binding protein (fHbp) antigen were 
      functional in a serum bactericidal assay. Our results demonstrate that multivalent 
      nanoparticles based on the T6SS sheath represent a versatile scaffold for vaccine 
      applications.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus sortase transpeptidase SrtA: insight into the kinetic 
      mechanism and evidence for a reverse protonation catalytic mechanism.
PG  - 11188-200
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase SrtA catalyzes the covalent attachment of 
      LPXTG-containing virulence and colonization-associated proteins to cell-wall 
      peptidoglycan in Gram-positive bacteria. Recent structural characterizations of 
      staphylococcal SrtA, and related transpeptidases SrtB from S. aureus and Bacillus 
      anthracis, provide many details regarding the active site environment, yet raise 
      questions with regard to the nature of catalysis and active site cysteine thiol 
      activation. Here we re-evaluate the kinetic mechanism of SrtA and shed light on 
      aspects of its catalytic mechanism. Using steady-state, pre-steady-state, 
      bisubstrate kinetic studies, and high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry, 
      revised steady-state kinetic parameters and a ping-pong hydrolytic shunt kinetic 
      mechanism were determined for recombinant SrtA. The pH dependencies of kinetic 
      parameters k(cat)/K(m) and k(cat) for the substrate Abz-LPETG-Dap(Dnp)-NH(2) were 
      bell-shaped with pK(a) values of 6.3 +/- 0.2 and 9.4 +/- 0.2 for k(cat) and 6.2 +/- 
      0.2 and 9.4 +/- 0.2 for k(cat)/K(m). Solvent isotope effect (SIE) measurements 
      revealed inverse behavior, with a (D)2(O)k(cat) of 0.89 +/- 0.01 and a 
      (D)2(O)(k(cat)/K(m)) of 0.57 +/- 0.03 reflecting an equilibrium SIE. In addition, 
      SIE measurements strongly implicated Cys184 participation in the isotope-sensitive 
      rate-determining chemical step when considered in conjunction with an inverse linear 
      proton inventory for k(cat). Last, the pH dependence of SrtA inactivation by 
      iodoacetamide revealed a single ionization for inactivation. These studies 
      collectively provide compelling evidence for a reverse protonation mechanism where a 
      small fraction (ca. 0.06%) of SrtA is competent for catalysis at physiological pH, 
      yet is highly active with an estimated k(cat)/K(m) of >10(5) M(-)(1) s(-)(1).

PG  - 23129-39
AB  - Sortases anchor surface proteins to the cell wall of Gram-positive pathogens through 
      recognition of specific motif sequences. Loss of sortase leads to large reductions 
      in virulence, which identifies sortase as a target for the development of 
      antibacterials. By screening 135,625 small molecules for inhibition, we report here 
      that aryl (beta-amino)ethyl ketones inhibit sortase enzymes from staphylococci and 
      bacilli. Inhibition of sortases occurs through an irreversible, covalent 
      modification of their active site cysteine. Sortases specifically activate this 
      class of molecules via beta-elimination, generating a reactive olefin intermediate 
      that covalently modifies the cysteine thiol. Analysis of the three-dimensional 
      structure of Bacillus anthracis sortase B with and without inhibitor provides 
      insights into the mechanism of inhibition and reveals binding pockets that can be 
      exploited for drug discovery.

AB  - Enzymes that catalyze efficient macrocyclization or site-specific ligation of 
      peptides and proteins can enable tools for drug design and protein engineering. Here 
      we describe a protocol to use butelase 1, a recently discovered peptide ligase, for 
      high-efficiency cyclization and ligation of peptides and proteins ranging in size 
      from 10 to >200 residues. Butelase 1 is the fastest known ligase and is found in 
      pods of the common medicinal plant Clitoria ternatea (also known as butterfly pea). 
      It has a very simple C-terminal-specific recognition motif that requires Asn/Asp 
      (Asx) at the P1 position and a dipeptide His-Val at the P1' and P2' positions. 
      Substrates for butelase-mediated ligation can be prepared by standard Fmoc 
      (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry or recombinant expression with the minimal 
      addition of this tripeptide Asn-His-Val motif at the C terminus. Butelase 1 achieves 
      cyclizations that are 20,000 times faster than those of sortase A, a commonly used 
      enzyme for backbone cyclization. Unlike sortase A, butelase is traceless, and it can 
      be used for the total synthesis of naturally occurring peptides and proteins. 
      Furthermore, butelase 1 is also useful for intermolecular ligations and synthesis of 
      peptide or protein thioesters, which are versatile activated intermediates necessary 
      for and compatible with many chemical ligation methods. The protocol describes steps 
      for isolation and purification of butelase 1 from plant extract using a four-step 
      chromatography procedure, which takes ∼3 d. We then describe steps for 
      intramolecular cyclization, intermolecular ligation and butelase-mediated synthesis 
      of protein thioesters. Butelase reactions are generally completed within minutes and 
      often achieve excellent yields.

AB  - The smallest natural antibody fragments currently available are single-domain 
      antibodies obtained from camelid species and sharks (variable new antigen 
      receptors). These molecules consist of a single amino acid chain of ~120 amino acids 
      that adopts a typical immunoglobulin fold. Single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) are 
      monovalent and can be isolated from immunized animals, from naïve libraries, or from 
      synthetic libraries. Importantly, their complete DNA sequences are readily obtained 
      by default, which greatly facilitates their rapid manipulation for various 
      applications. Here, a PCR-based protocol for inserting a sortase A recognition 
      sequence at the carboxy-terminus of a nanobody is described. Subsequently, a sortase 
      A-catalyzed biochemical reaction results in tagging of the nanobody with a short 
      carboxy-terminal amino acid sequence that carries a non-canonical residue (propargyl 
      glycine). This allows click chemistry to be performed with an azido-derivatized 
      fluorophore, with the ensuing fluorescent nanobody being covalently and 
      site-specifically labeled. The labeled nanobody can be used directly for 
      immunocytochemistry, omitting the classical secondary antibody step. Also described 
      are methods for delivery of fluorescent nanobodies into the cytoplasm of mammalian 
      cells by photoporation, a very low-toxicity approach involving laser light and 
      graphene quantum dots. The combined protocol embodies a novel route for studying 
      protein function in living cells at high resolution.

TI  - Pilin and sortase residues critical for endocarditis- and biofilm-associated pilus 
      biogenesis in Enterococcus faecalis.
PG  - 4484-95
LID - 10.1128/JB.00451-13 [doi]
AB  - Enterococci commonly cause hospital-acquired infections, such as infective 
      endocarditis and catheter-associated urinary tract infections. In animal models of 
      these infections, a long hairlike extracellular protein fiber known as the 
      endocarditis- and biofilm-associated (Ebp) pilus is an important virulence factor 
      for Enterococcus faecalis. For Ebp and other sortase-assembled pili, the 
      pilus-associated sortases are essential for fiber formation as they create covalent 
      isopeptide bonds between the sortase recognition motif and the pilin-like motif of 
      the pilus subunits. However, the molecular requirements governing the incorporation 
      of the three pilus subunits (EbpA, EbpB, and EbpC) have not been investigated in E. 
      faecalis. Here, we show that a Lys residue within the pilin-like motif of the EbpC 
      subunit was necessary for EbpC polymerization. However, incorporation of EbpA into 
      the pilus fiber only required its sortase recognition motif (LPXTG), while 
      incorporation of EbpB only required its pilin-like motif. Only the sortase 
      recognition motif would be required for incorporation of the pilus tip subunit, 
      while incorporation of the base subunit would only require the pilin recognition 
      motif. Thus, these data support a model with EbpA at the tip and EbpB at the base of 
      an EbpC polymer. In addition, the housekeeping sortase, SrtA, was found to process 
      EbpB and its predicted catalytic Cys residue was required for efficient cell wall 
      anchoring of mature Ebp pili. Thus, we have defined molecular interactions involved 
      in fiber polymerization, minor subunit organization, and pilus subcellular 
      compartmentalization in the E. faecalis Ebp pilus system. These studies advance our 
      understanding of unique molecular mechanisms of sortase-assembled pilus biogenesis.

TI  - A Counterselectable Sucrose Sensitivity Marker Permits Efficient and Flexible 
      Mutagenesis in Streptococcus agalactiae.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03009-18 [doi]
LID - e03009-18
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) is a cause of severe 
      infections, particularly during the newborn period. While methods exist for 
      generating chromosomal mutations in GBS, they are cumbersome and inefficient and 
      present significant challenges if the goal is to study subtle mutations, such as 
      single-base-pair polymorphisms. To address this problem, we have developed an 
      efficient and flexible GBS mutagenesis protocol based on sucrose counterselection 
      against levansucrase (SacB) expressed from a temperature-selective shuttle vector. 
      GBS containing the SacB expression cassette demonstrates lethal sensitivity to 
      supplemental sucrose whether the plasmid DNA is replicating outside of the 
      chromosome or has been integrated during a crossover event. Transmission electron 
      microscopy shows that SacB-mediated lethal sucrose sensitivity results from the 
      accumulation of inclusion bodies that eventually lead to complete degradation of 
      normal cellular architecture and subsequent lysis. We used this new mutagenesis 
      technique to generate an in-frame, allelic exchange knockout of the GBS sortase gene 
      srtA, demonstrating that >99% of colonies that emerge from our protocol had the 
      expected knockout phenotype and that among a subset tested by sequencing, 100% had 
      the correct genotype. We also generated barcoded nonsense mutations in the cylE gene 
      in two GBS strains, showing that the approach can be used to make small, precise 
      chromosomal mutations.IMPORTANCE The ability to generate chromosomal mutations is 
      fundamental to microbiology. Historically, however, GBS pathogenesis research has 
      been made challenging by the relative genetic intractability of the organism. 
      Generating a single knockout in GBS using traditional techniques can take many 
      months, with highly variable success rates. Furthermore, traditional methods do not 
      offer a straightforward way to generate single-base-pair polymorphisms or other 
      subtle changes, especially to noncoding regions of the chromosome. We have developed 
      a new sucrose counterselection-based method that permits rapid, efficient, and 
      flexible GBS mutagenesis. Our technique requires no additional equipment beyond what 
      is needed for traditional approaches. We believe that it will catalyze rapid 
      advances in GBS genetics research by significantly easing the path to generating 
      mutants.

      Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen that causes subclinical mastitis 
      associated with huge economic losses to the dairy industry. A few vaccines for 
      bovine mastitis are available, and they are expected to induce the production of S. 
      aureus-specific antibodies that prevent bacterial adherence to host cells or promote 
      opsonization by phagocytes. However, the efficacy of such vaccines are still under 
      debate; therefore, further research focusing on improving the current vaccines by 
      seeking additional mechanisms of action is required to reduce economic losses due to 
      mastitis in the dairy industry. Here, we generated S. aureus-specific bovine IgG 
      antibodies (anti-S. aureus) that directly inhibited bacterial growth in vitro. 
      Inhibition depended on specificity for anti-S. aureus, not the interaction between 
      Protein A and the fragment crystallizable region of the IgG antibodies or bacterial 
      agglutination. An in vitro culture study using S. aureus strain JE2 and its deletion 
      mutant JE2ΔSrtA, which lacks the gene encoding sortase A, revealed that the effect 
      of anti-S. aureus was sortase-A-independent. Sortase A is involved in the synthesis 
      of cell-wall-associated proteins. Thus, other surface molecules, such as membrane 
      proteins, cell surface polysaccharides, or both, may trigger the inhibition of 
      bacterial growth by anti-S. aureus. Together, our findings contribute insights into 
      developing new strategies to further improve the available mastitis vaccine by 
      designing a novel antigen on the surface of S. aureus to induce inhibitory signals 
      that prevent bacterial growth.

TI  - Structure and specificity of a new class of Ca(2+)-independent housekeeping sortase 
      from Streptomyces avermitilis provide insights into its non-canonical substrate 
      preference.
PG  - 7244-7257
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.782037 [doi]
AB  - Surface proteins in Gram-positive bacteria are incorporated into the cell wall 
      through a peptide ligation reaction catalyzed by transpeptidase sortase. Six main 
      classes (A-F) of sortase have been identified of which class A sortase is meant for 
      housekeeping functions. The prototypic housekeeping sortase A (SaSrtA) from 
      Staphylococcus aureus cleaves LPXTG-containing proteins at the scissile T-G peptide 
      bond and ligates protein-LPXT to the terminal Gly residue of the nascent 
      cross-bridge of peptidoglycan lipid II precursor. Sortase-mediated ligation 
      ("sortagging") of LPXTG-containing substrates and Gly-terminated nucleophiles occurs 
      in vitro as well as in cellulo in the presence of Ca(2+) and has been applied 
      extensively for protein conjugations. Although the majority of applications emanate 
      from SaSrtA, low catalytic efficiency, LPXTG specificity restriction, and Ca(2+) 
      requirement (particularly for in cellulo applications) remain a drawback. Given that 
      Gram-positive bacteria genomes encode a variety of sortases, natural sortase mining 
      can be a viable complementary approach akin to engineering of wild-type SaSrtA. 
      Here, we describe the structure and specificity of a new class E sortase (SavSrtE) 
      annotated to perform housekeeping roles in Streptomyces avermitilis Biochemical 
      experiments define the attributes of an optimum peptide substrate, demonstrate 
      Ca(2+)-independent activity, and provide insights about contrasting functional 
      characteristics of SavSrtE and SaSrtA. Crystal structure, substrate docking, and 
      mutagenesis experiments have identified a critical residue that dictates the 
      preference for a non-canonical LAXTG recognition motif over LPXTG. These results 
      have implications for rational tailoring of substrate tolerance in sortases. 
      Besides, Ca(2+)-independent orthogonal specificity of SavSrtE is likely to expand 
      the sortagging toolkit.

AB  - We provide the first demonstration that isopeptide ligation, a noncanonical activity 
      of the enzyme sortase A, can be used to modify recombinant proteins. This reaction 
      was used in vitro to conjugate small molecules to a peptide, an engineered targeting 
      protein, and a full-length monoclonal antibody with an exquisite level of control 
      over the site of conjugation. Attachment to the protein substrate occurred 
      exclusively through isopeptide bonds at a lysine ε-amino group within a specific 
      amino acid sequence. This reaction allows more than one molecule to be 
      site-specifically conjugated to a protein at internal sites, thereby overcoming 
      significant limitations of the canonical native peptide ligation reaction catalyzed 
      by sortase A. Our method provides a unique chemical ligation procedure that is 
      orthogonal to existing methods, supplying a new method to site-specifically modify 
      lysine residues that will be a valuable addition to the protein conjugation toolbox.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-0243-0_18 [doi]
AB  - Affibody molecules are small engineered scaffold proteins suitable for in vivo tumor 
      targeting. Radionuclide molecular imaging using directly radiolabelled affibody 
      molecules provides excellent imaging. However, affibody molecules have a high renal 
      reabsorption, which complicates their use for radionuclide therapy. The high renal 
      reabsorption is a common problem for the use of engineered scaffold proteins for 
      radionuclide therapy. Affibody-based PNA-mediated pretargeting reduces 
      dramatically the absorbed dose to the kidneys and makes affibody-based radionuclide 
      therapy possible. This methodology might, hopefully, solve the problem of high renal 
      reabsorption for radionuclide therapy mediated by other engineered scaffold 
      proteins.

AB  - Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) are cariogenic microorganisms. Sortase A (SrtA) is 
      a transpeptidase that attaches Pac to the cell surface. The biofilm formation of S. 
      mutans is promoted by SrtA regulated Pac. Myricetin (Myr) has a variety of 
      pharmacological properties, including inhibiting SrtA activity of Staphylococcus 
      aureus. The purpose of this research was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Myr 
      on SrtA of S. mutans and its subsequent influence on the biofilm formation. Here, 
      Myr was discovered as a potent inhibitor of S. mutans SrtA, with an IC(50) of 48.66 
      ± 1.48 μM, which was lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 512 
      ug/mL. Additionally, immunoblot and biofilm assays demonstrated that Myr at a 
      sub-MIC level could reduce adhesion and biofilm formation of S. mutans. The 
      reduction of biofilm was possibly caused by the decreased amount of Pac on the 
      cells' surface by releasing Pac into the medium via inhibiting SrtA activity. 
      Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays suggested that Met123, Ile191, 
      and Arg213 of SrtA were pivotal for the interaction of SrtA and Myr. Our findings 
      indicate that Myr is a promising candidate for the control of dental caries by 
      modulating Pac-involved adhesive mechanisms without developing drug resistance to 
      S.mutans.

TI  - Sortase ligation enables homogeneous GPCR phosphorylation to reveal diversity in 
      β-arrestin coupling.
PG  - 3834-3839
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1722336115 [doi]
AB  - The ability of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate complex cascades of 
      cellular signaling is governed by the sequential coupling of three main transducer 
      proteins, G protein, GPCR kinase (GRK), and β-arrestin. Mounting evidence indicates 
      these transducers all have distinct conformational preferences and binding modes. 
      However, interrogating each transducer's mechanism of interaction with GPCRs has 
      been complicated by the interplay of transducer-mediated signaling events. For 
      example, GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation recruits and induces conformational 
      changes in β-arrestin, which facilitates coupling to the GPCR transmembrane core. 
      Here we compare the allosteric interactions of G proteins and β-arrestins with 
      GPCRs' transmembrane cores by using the enzyme sortase to ligate a synthetic 
      phosphorylated peptide onto the carboxyl terminus of three different receptors. 
      Phosphopeptide ligation onto the β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR) allows 
      stabilization of a high-affinity receptor active state by β-arrestin1, permitting us 
      to define elements in the β(2)AR and β-arrestin1 that contribute to the receptor 
      transmembrane core interaction. Interestingly, ligation of the identical 
      phosphopeptide onto the β(2)AR, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 and the 
      μ-opioid receptor reveals that the ability of β-arrestin1 to enhance agonist binding 
      relative to G protein differs substantially among receptors. Furthermore, strong 
      allosteric coupling of β-arrestin1 correlates with its ability to attenuate, or 
      "desensitize," G protein activation in vitro. Sortase ligation thus provides a 
      versatile method to introduce complex, defined phosphorylation patterns into GPCRs, 
      and analogous strategies could be applied to other classes of posttranslationally 
      modified proteins. These homogeneously phosphorylated GPCRs provide an innovative 
      means to systematically study receptor-transducer interactions.

TI  - Confirmation of a Protein-Protein Interaction in the Pantothenate Biosynthetic 
      Pathway by Using Sortase-Mediated Labelling.
PG  - 753-8
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201500547 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput studies have been widely used to identify protein-protein 
      interactions; however, few of these candidate interactions have been confirmed in 
      vitro. We have used a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and 
      fluorescence anisotropy to screen candidate interactions within the pantothenate 
      biosynthetic pathway. In particular, we observed no interaction between the next 
      enzyme in the pathway, pantothenate synthetase (PS), and aspartate decarboxylase, 
      but did observe an interaction between PS and the putative Nudix hydrolase, YfcD. 
      Confirmation of the interaction by fluorescence anisotropy was dependent upon 
      labelling an adventitiously formed glycine on the protein N-terminal affinity 
      purification tag by using Sortase. Subsequent formation of the protein-protein 
      complex led to apparent restriction of the dynamics of this tag, thus suggesting 
      that this approach could be generally applied to a subset of other protein-protein 
      interaction complexes.

TI  - Hairpin RNA-induced conformational change of a eukaryotic-specific lysyl-tRNA 
      synthetase extension and role of adjacent anticodon-binding domain.
PG  - 12071-12085
LID - S0021-9258(17)50069-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1074/jbc.RA120.013852 [doi]
AB  - Human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (hLysRS) is essential for aminoacylation of tRNA(Lys) 
      Higher eukaryotic LysRSs possess an N-terminal extension (Nterm) previously shown to 
      facilitate high-affinity tRNA binding and aminoacylation. This eukaryote-specific 
      appended domain also plays a critical role in hLysRS nuclear localization, thus 
      facilitating noncanonical functions of hLysRS. The structure is intrinsically 
      disordered and therefore remains poorly characterized. Findings of previous studies 
      are consistent with the Nterm domain undergoing a conformational transition to an 
      ordered structure upon nucleic acid binding. In this study, we used NMR to 
      investigate how the type of RNA, as well as the presence of the adjacent 
      anticodon-binding domain (ACB), influences the Nterm conformation. To explore the 
      latter, we used sortase A ligation to produce a segmentally labeled tandem-domain 
      protein, Nterm-ACB. In the absence of RNA, Nterm remained disordered regardless of 
      ACB attachment. Both alone and when attached to ACB, Nterm structure remained 
      unaffected by titration with single-stranded RNAs. The central region of the Nterm 
      domain adopted α-helical structure upon titration of Nterm and Nterm-ACB with RNA 
      hairpins containing double-stranded regions. Nterm binding to the RNA hairpins 
      resulted in CD spectral shifts consistent with an induced helical structure. NMR and 
      fluorescence anisotropy revealed that Nterm binding to hairpin RNAs is weak but that 
      the binding affinity increases significantly upon covalent attachment to ACB. We 
      conclude that the ACB domain facilitates induced-fit conformational changes and 
      confers high-affinity RNA hairpin binding, which may be advantageous for functional 
      interactions of LysRS with a variety of different binding partners.

TI  - Picomolar SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Using Multi-Arm PEG Nanobody Constructs.
LID - 10.3390/biom10121661 [doi]
LID - 1661
AB  - Multivalent antibody constructs have a broad range of clinical and biotechnological 
      applications. Nanobodies are especially useful as components for multivalent 
      constructs as they allow increased valency while maintaining a small molecule size. 
      We here describe a novel, rapid method for the generation of bi- and multivalent 
      nanobody constructs with oriented assembly by Cu-free strain promoted azide-alkyne 
      click chemistry (SPAAC). We used sortase A for ligation of click chemistry 
      functional groups site-specifically to the C-terminus of nanobodies before creating 
      C-to-C-terminal nanobody fusions and 4-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) tetrameric 
      nanobody constructs. We demonstrated the viability of this approach by generating 
      constructs with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody Ty1. We compared the ability of 
      the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious 
      virus in neutralization assays. The generated dimers neutralized the virus similarly 
      to a nanobody-Fc fusion variant, while a 4-arm PEG based tetrameric Ty1 construct 
      dramatically enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC(50) in the low 
      picomolar range.

AB  - Biomaterial platforms are an integral part of stem cell biomanufacturing protocols. 
      The collective biophysical, biochemical, and cellular cues of the stem cell niche 
      microenvironment play an important role in regulating stem cell fate decisions. 
      Three-dimensional (3D) culture of stem cells within biomaterials provides a route to 
      present biophysical and biochemical stimuli through cell-matrix interactions and 
      cell-cell interactions via secreted biomolecules. Herein, we describe a 
      maleimide-functionalized gelatin (GelMAL) hydrogel that can be crosslinked via 
      thiol-Michael addition click reaction for the encapsulation of sensitive stem cell 
      populations. The maleimide functional units along the gelatin backbone enables 
      gelation via the addition of a dithiol crosslinker without requiring external 
      stimuli (e.g., UV light, photoinitiator), thereby reducing reactive oxide species 
      generation. Additionally, the versatility of crosslinker selection enables easy 
      insertion of thiol-containing bioactive or bioinert motifs. Hematopoietic stem cells 
      (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were encapsulated in GelMAL, with 
      mechanical properties tuned to mimic the in vivo bone marrow niche. We report the 
      insertion of a cleavable peptide crosslinker that can be degraded by the proteolytic 
      action of Sortase A, a mammalian-inert enzyme. Notably, Sortase A exposure preserves 
      stem cell surface markers, which are an essential metric of hematopoietic activity 
      used in immunophenotyping. This novel GelMAL system enables a route to produce 
      artificial stem cell niches with tunable biophysical properties, intrinsic 
      cell-interaction motifs, and orthogonal addition of bioactive crosslinks. STATEMENT 
      OF SIGNIFICANCE: We describe a maleimide-functionalized gelatin hydrogel that can be 
      crosslinked via a thiol-maleimide mediated click reaction to form a stable hydrogel 
      without the production of reactive oxygen species typical in light-based 
      crosslinking. The mechanical properties can be tuned to match the in vivo bone 
      marrow microenvironment for hematopoietic stem cell culture. Additionally, we report 
      inclusion of a peptide crosslinker that can be cleaved via the proteolytic action of 
      Sortase A and show that Sortase A exposure does not degrade sensitive surface marker 
      expression patterns. Together, this approach reduces stem cell exposure to reactive 
      oxygen species during hydrogel gelation and enables post-culture quantitative 
      assessment of stem cell phenotype.

AB  - Antibody fragments, as the products of engineered antibodies, exhibit great 
      potential for cancer therapy and imaging. Antibody fragment drug conjugates (AFDCs), 
      which conjugate the highly specific, low-immunity and small-sized antibody fragments 
      with cytotoxic payloads, can overcome the limitations of traditional IgG format 
      drugs in cancer therapy. In this study, a commercialized anti-CD20 monoclonal 
      antibody, ofatumumab (OFA), was applied to generate two site-specific monomethyl 
      auristain E (MMAE)-conjugated AFDCs (Fab-vcMMAE, Fab-CH3mut-vcMMAE) by Sortase A 
      mediated transpeptidation. Compared with OFA-vcMMAE, the two AFDCs maintained most 
      of the binding affinity and the ability of internalization. In vitro studies 
      revealed that Fab-vcMMAE and OFA-vcMMAE had almost identical IC(50) values against 
      CD20-positive cell lines, while Fab-CH3-vcMMAE had a lower anti-tumor activity. In 
      vivo studies showed that Fab-vcMMAE had a significantly higher maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTDs), a 30-fold shorter half-life, and slightly lower antitumor activity 
      within the MTDs than OFA-vcMMAE. The distribution study showed that both of the Fab 
      and Fab-CH3mut had higher penetration rates into the tumors than OFA in a xenograft 
      model. Additionally, no obvious difference in tumor drug accumulation was found 
      between the Fab and OFA groups after the penetration process, but the Fab-CH3mut 
      group exhibited less tumor drug accumulation, possibly contributing to the inferior 
      anti-tumor activity of Fab-CH3mut-vcMMAE in vivo. Overall, we preliminarily 
      demonstrated the characteristics of AFDCs by studying OFA-based AFDCs. Our results 
      revealed that Fab is a promising carrier of MMAE to enhance the anti-tumor activity 
      and increase the safety profile compared with OFA.

TI  - Cell-to-cell interaction requires optimal positioning of a pilus tip adhesin

PG  - 18041-18049
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1907733116 [doi]
AB  - Assembly of pili on the gram-positive bacterial cell wall involves 2 conserved 
      transpeptidase enzymes named sortases: One for polymerization of pilin subunits and 
      another for anchoring pili to peptidoglycan. How this machine controls pilus length 
      and whether pilus length is critical for cell-to-cell interactions remain unknown. 
      We report here in Actinomyces oris, a key colonizer in the development of oral 
      biofilms, that genetic disruption of its housekeeping sortase SrtA generates 
      exceedingly long pili, catalyzed by its pilus-specific sortase SrtC2 that possesses 
      both pilus polymerization and cell wall anchoring functions. Remarkably, the 
      srtA-deficient mutant fails to mediate interspecies interactions, or coaggregation, 
      even though the coaggregation factor CafA is present at the pilus tip. Increasing 
      ectopic expression of srtA in the mutant progressively shortens pilus length and 
      restores coaggregation accordingly, while elevated levels of shaft pilins and SrtC2 
      produce long pili and block coaggregation by SrtA(+) bacteria. With structural 
      studies, we uncovered 2 key structural elements in SrtA that partake in recognition 
      of pilin substrates and regulate pilus length by inducing the capture and transfer 
      of pilus polymers to the cell wall. Evidently, coaggregation requires proper 
      positioning of the tip adhesin CafA via modulation of pilus length by the 
      housekeeping sortase SrtA.

TI  - Natural and Synthetic Sortase A Substrates Are Processed by Staphylococcus aureus 
      via Different Pathways.
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.2c00012 [doi]
AB  - Endogenous Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (SrtA) covalently incorporates cell wall 
      anchored proteins equipped with a SrtA recognition motif (LPXTG) via a lipid 
      II-dependent pathway into the staphylococcal peptidoglycan layer. Previously, we 
      found that the endogenous S. aureus SrtA is able to recognize and process a variety 
      of exogenously added synthetic SrtA substrates, including K(FITC)LPMTG-amide and 
      K(FITC)-K-vancomycin-LPMTG-amide. These synthetic substrates are covalently 
      incorporated into the bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) of S. aureus with varying 
      efficiencies. In this study, we examined if native and synthetic substrates are 
      processed by SrtA via the same pathway. Therefore, the effect of the lipid II 
      inhibiting antibiotic bacitracin on the incorporation of native and synthetic SrtA 
      substrates was assessed. Treatment of S. aureus with bacitracin resulted in a 
      decreased incorporation of protein A in the bacterial cell wall, whereas 
      incorporation of exogenous synthetic substrates was increased. These results suggest 
      that natural and exogenous synthetic substrates are processed by S. aureus via 
      different pathways.

TI  - Chemical Synthesis of a Full-Length G-Protein-Coupled Receptor β(2)-Adrenergic 
      Receptor with Defined Modification Patterns at the C-Terminus.
PG  - 17566-17576
LID - 10.1021/jacs.1c07369 [doi]
AB  - The β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that 
      responds to the hormone adrenaline and is an important drug target in the context of 
      respiratory diseases, including asthma. β(2)AR function can be regulated by 
      post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination at the 
      C-terminus, but access to the full-length β(2)AR with well-defined and homogeneous 
      modification patterns critical for biochemical and biophysical studies remains 
      challenging. Here, we report a practical synthesis of differentially modified, 
      full-length β(2)AR based on a combined native chemical ligation (NCL) and sortase 
      ligation strategy. An array of homogeneous samples of full-length β(2)ARs with 
      distinct modification patterns, including a full-length β(2)AR bearing both 
      monoubiquitination and octaphosphorylation modifications, were successfully prepared 
      for the first time. Using these homogeneously modified full-length β(2)AR receptors, 
      we found that different phosphorylation patterns mediate different interactions with 
      β-arrestin1 as reflected in different agonist binding affinities. Our experiments 
      also indicated that ubiquitination can further modulate interactions between β(2)AR 
      and β-arrestin1. Access to full-length β(2)AR with well-defined and homogeneous 
      modification patterns at the C-terminus opens a door to further in-depth mechanistic 
      studies into the structure and dynamics of β(2)AR complexes with downstream 
      transducer proteins, including G proteins, arrestins, and GPCR kinases.

TI  - Sortase-mediated modification of αDEC205 affords optimization of antigen 
      presentation and immunization against a set of viral epitopes.
PG  - 1428-33
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1214994110 [doi]
AB  - A monoclonal antibody against the C-type lectin DEC205 (αDEC205) is an effective 
      vehicle for delivery of antigens to dendritic cells through creation of covalent 
      αDEC205-antigen adducts. These adducts can induce antigen-specific T-cell immune 
      responses or tolerance. We exploit the transpeptidase activity of sortase to install 
      modified peptides and protein-sized antigens onto the heavy chain of αDEC205, 
      including linkers that contain nonnatural amino acids. We demonstrate stoichiometric 
      site-specific labeling on a scale not easily achievable by genetic fusions (49 
      distinct fusions in this report). We conjugated a biotinylated version of a class I 
      MHC-restricted epitope to unlabeled αDEC205 and monitored epitope generation upon 
      binding of the adduct to dendritic cells. Our results show transfer of αDEC205 heavy 
      chain to the cytoplasm, followed by proteasomal degradation. Introduction of a 
      labile dipeptide linker at the N terminus of a T-cell epitope improves 
      proteasome-dependent class I MHC-restricted peptide cross-presentation when 
      delivered by αDEC205 in vitro and in vivo. We also conjugated αDEC205 with a 
      linker-optimized peptide library of known CD8 T-cell epitopes from the mouse 
      γ-herpes virus 68. Animals immunized with such conjugates displayed a 10-fold 
      reduction in viral load.

TI  - Development of an Enzyme-Mediated, Site-Specific Method to Conjugate Toll-Like 
      Receptor 2 Agonists onto Protein Antigens: Toward a Broadly Protective, Four 
      Component, Group A Streptococcal Self-Adjuvanting Lipoprotein-Fusion Combination 
      Vaccine.
PG  - 1770-1782
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00047 [doi]
AB  - Subunit vaccines composed of protein antigens covalently attached to Toll-like 
      receptor (TLR) agonists elicit superior immune responses compared to mixtures of 
      antigens and TLR agonists. Among different conjugation approaches, enzyme-mediated 
      ligation is one of the few that provides an opportunity for the generation of 
      homogeneous, molecularly defined products in which protein antigens are maintained 
      with native structures, which is most critical to elicit protective immune responses 
      upon vaccination. Four highly conserved protein antigens from Group A Streptococcus 
      (GAS) have the potential to be safe and efficacious vaccine candidates. After a TLR2 
      agonist fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1) was successfully attached onto 
      each antigen using sortase A and techniques for their purification were developed, a 
      combination vaccine containing interleukin 8 (IL-8) protease (Streptococcus pyogenes 
      cell envelope proteinase [SpyCEP]), Group A Streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCPA), 
      anchorless virulence factor arginine deiminase (ADI), and trigger factor (TF)-TLR2 
      conjugates was produced. This combination was assessed for immunity in mice and 
      compared with mixtures of the four antigens with FSL-1 or alum. High titer 
      antigen-specific IgG antibodies were detected from all vaccine groups, with 
      antibodies elicited from FSL-1 conjugates around 10-fold higher compared to the 
      FSL-1 mixture group. Furthermore, the FSL-1 conjugates afforded a more balanced 
      T(H)1/T(H)2 immune response than the alum-adjuvanted group, suggesting that this 
      combination vaccine represents a promising candidate for the prevention of GAS 
      diseases. Thus, we established a conjugation platform that allows for the production 
      of defined, site-specific antigen-adjuvant conjugates, which maintain the native 
      three-dimensional structure of antigens and can be potentially applied to a variety 
      of protein antigens.

AB  - Three new tripeptide derivatives asterripeptides A-C (1-3) were isolated from 
      Vietnamese mangrove-derived fungus Aspergillus terreus LM.5.2. Structures of 
      isolated compounds were determined by a combination of NMR and ESIMS techniques. The 
      absolute configurations of all stereocenters were determined using the Murfey's 
      method. The isolated compounds 1-3 contain a rare fungi cinnamic acid residue. The 
      cytotoxicity of isolated compounds against several cancer cell lines and inhibition 
      ability of sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus of asterripeptides A-C were 
      investigated.

AB  - Artificial multiprotein complexes are sought after reagents for biomolecular 
      engineering. A current limiting factor is the paucity of molecular scaffolds which 
      allow for site-specific multicomponent assembly. Here, we address this limitation by 
      synthesizing bioorthogonal elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) scaffolds containing 
      periodic noncanonical l-azidohomoalanine amino acids in the guest residue position. 
      The nine azide ELP guest residues served as conjugation sites for site-specific 
      modification with dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-functionalized single-domain antibodies 
      (SdAbs) through strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). Sortase A and 
      ybbR tags at the C- and N-termini of the ELP scaffold provided two additional sites 
      for derivatization with small molecules and peptides by Sortase A and 
      4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Sfp), respectively. These functional groups are 
      chemically bioorthogonal, mutually compatible, and highly efficient, thereby 
      enabling synthesis of multi-antibody ELP complexes in a one-pot reaction. We 
      demonstrate application of this material for enhancing the performance of sandwich 
      immunoassays of the recombinant protein mCherry. In undiluted human plasma, surfaces 
      modified with multi-antibody ELP complexes showed between 2.3- and 14.3-fold 
      improvement in sensitivity and ∼30-40% lower limits of detection as compared with 
      nonspecifically adsorbed antibodies. Dual-labeled multi-antibody ELP complexes were 
      further used for cytometric labeling and analysis of live eukaryotic cells. These 
      results demonstrate how multiple antibodies complexed onto bioorthogonal 
      protein-based polymers can be used to enhance immunospecific binding interactions 
      through multivalency effects.

TI  - Insights into the biochemical and functional characterization of sortase E 
      transpeptidase of Corynebacterium glutamicum.
PG  - 3835-3847
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20190812 [doi]
AB  - Most Gram-positive bacteria contain a membrane-bound transpeptidase known as sortase 
      which covalently incorporates the surface proteins on to the cell wall. The 
      sortase-displayed protein structures are involved in cell attachment, nutrient 
      uptake and aerial hyphae formation. Among the six classes of sortase (A-F), sortase 
      A of S. aureus is the well-characterized housekeeping enzyme considered as an ideal 
      drug target and a valuable biochemical reagent for protein engineering. Similar to 
      SrtA, class E sortase in GC rich bacteria plays a housekeeping role which is not 
      studied extensively. However, C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, an industrially important 
      organism known for amino acid production, carries a single putative sortase 
      (NCgl2838) gene but neither in vitro peptide cleavage activity nor biochemical 
      characterizations have been investigated. Here, we identified that the gene is 
      having a sortase activity and analyzed its structural similarity with Cd-SrtF. The 
      purified enzyme showed a greater affinity toward LAXTG substrate with a calculated 
      KM of 12 ± 1 µM, one of the highest affinities reported for this class of enzyme. 
      Moreover, site-directed mutation studies were carried to ascertain the structure 
      functional relationship of Cg-SrtE and all these are new findings which will enable 
      us to perceive exciting protein engineering applications with this class of enzyme 
      from a non-pathogenic microbe.

AB  - At their margins, tumors often contain neutrophils, dendritic cells, and activated 
      macrophages, which express class II MHC and CD11b products. The interplay between 
      stromal cells, tumor cells, and migratory cells such as lymphocytes creates 
      opportunities for noninvasive imaging of immune responses. We developed 
      alpaca-derived antibody fragments specific for mouse class II MHC and CD11b 
      products, expressed on the surface of a variety of myeloid cells. We validated these 
      reagents by flow cytometry and two-photon microscopy to obtain images at cellular 
      resolution. To enable noninvasive imaging of the targeted cell populations, we 
      developed a method to site-specifically label VHHs [the variable domain (VH) of a 
      camelid heavy-chain only antibody] with (18)F or (64)Cu. Radiolabeled VHHs rapidly 
      cleared the circulation (t1/2 ≈ 20 min) and clearly visualized lymphoid organs. We 
      used VHHs to explore the possibility of imaging inflammation in both xenogeneic and 
      syngeneic tumor models, which resulted in detection of tumors with remarkable 
      specificity. We also imaged the infiltration of myeloid cells upon injection of 
      complete Freund's adjuvant. Both anti-class II MHC and anti-CD11b VHHs detected 
      inflammation with excellent specificity. Given the ease of manufacture and labeling 
      of VHHs, we believe that this method could transform the manner in which antitumor 
      responses and/or infectious events may be tracked.

      secretory pathway and those containing the so-called LPXTG sorting motif are 
      covalently attached to the peptidoglycan by sortase A. How SecA, sortase A, and 
      LPXTG proteins are spatially distributed in GBS is not known. In the close relative 
      Streptococcus pyogenes, it was shown that presence of the YSIRKG/S motif (literally 
      YSIRKX3Gx2S) in the signal peptide (SP) constitutes the targeting information for 
      secretion at the septum. Here, using conventional and deconvolution 
      immunofluorescence analyses, we have studied in GBS strain NEM316 the localization 
      of SecA, SrtA, and the secreted protein Bsp whose signal peptide contains a 
      canonical YSIRKG/S motif (YSLRKykfGlaS). Replacing the SP of Bsp with four other SPs 
      containing or not the YSIRKG/S motif did not alter the localized secretion of Bsp at 
      the equatorial ring. Our results indicate that secretion and cell wall-anchoring 
      machineries are localized at the division septum. Cell wall- anchored proteins 
      displayed polar (PilB, Gbs0791), punctuate (CspA) or uniform distribution (Alp2) on 
      the bacterial surface. De novo secretion of Gbs0791 following trypsin treatment 
      indicates that it is secreted at the septum, then redistributed along the lateral 
      sides, and finally accumulated to the poles. We conclude that the ±YSIRK SP rule 
      driving compartimentalized secretion is not true in S. agalactiae.

TI  - Enhanced pyruvate production in Candida glabrata by carrier engineering.
PG  - 473-482
LID - 10.1002/bit.26477 [doi]
AB  - Pyruvate is an important organic acid that plays a key role in the central metabolic 
      pathway. Manipulating transporters is an efficient strategy to enhance production of 
      target organic acids and a means to understand the effects of altered intracellular 
      pyruvate content on global metabolic networks. Efforts have been made to manipulate 
      mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) to transport pyruvate into different 
      subcellular compartments in Candida glabrata to demonstrate the effects of the 
      subcellular distribution of pyruvate on central carbon metabolism. By increasing the 
      mitochondrial pyruvate content through enhancing the rate of pyruvate transport into 
      mitochondria, a high central carbon metabolism rate, specific growth rate and 
      specific pyruvate production rate were obtained. Comparing the intracellular 
      pyruvate content of engineered and control strains showed that higher intracellular 
      pyruvate levels were not conducive to improving pyruvate productivity or central 
      carbon metabolism. Plasma membrane expression of MPCs significantly increased the 
      expression levels of key rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes. Moreover, pyruvate 
      production of CGΔura3-Sp-MPC1, CGΔura3-Sp-MPC2, and CGΔura3-Sp-MPC1-Sp-MPC2 
      increased 134.4%, 120.3%, and 30.0%, respectively. In conclusion, lower 
      intracellular pyruvate content enhanced central carbon metabolism and provided 
      useful clues for improving the production of other organic acids in microorganisms.

AB  - Sortase A catalyzed ligation of ultra-short peptides leads to inter/intra-molecular 
      transpeptidation to form either linear or cyclic oligomers dependent upon the 
      peptide length. Cyclic peptides were the main products for peptides with more than 
      15aa. However, for ultra-short (<15aa) peptides, cyclic oligomers became predominant 
      in prolonged reactions. Peptides with 1-3 aminoglycines were equally active but 
      peptide oligomers from peptide containing more than one aminoglycine were prone to 
      hydrolysis.

TI  - PorZ, an Essential Component of the Type IX Secretion System of Porphyromonas 
      gingivalis, Delivers Anionic Lipopolysaccharide to the PorU Sortase for 
      Transpeptidase Processing of T9SS Cargo Proteins.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.02262-20 [doi]
LID - e02262-20
AB  - Cargo proteins of the type IX secretion system (T9SS) in human pathogens from the 
      Bacteroidetes phylum invariably possess a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that 
      functions as a signal for outer membrane (OM) translocation. In Porphyromonas 
      gingivalis, the CTD of cargos is cleaved off after translocation, and anionic 
      lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) is attached. This transpeptidase reaction anchors 
      secreted proteins to the OM. PorZ, a cell surface-associated protein, is an 
      essential component of the T9SS whose function was previously unknown. We recently 
      solved the crystal structure of PorZ and found that it consists of two β-propeller 
      moieties, followed by a CTD. In this study, we performed structure-based modeling, 
      suggesting that PorZ is a carbohydrate-binding protein. Indeed, we found that 
      recombinant PorZ specifically binds A-LPS in vitro Binding was blocked by monoclonal 
      antibodies that specifically react with a phosphorylated branched mannan in the 
      anionic polysaccharide (A-PS) component of A-LPS, but not with the core 
      oligosaccharide or the lipid A endotoxin. Examination of A-LPS derived from a cohort 
      of mutants producing various truncations of A-PS confirmed that the phosphorylated 
      branched mannan is indeed the PorZ ligand. Moreover, purified recombinant PorZ 
      interacted with the PorU sortase in an A-LPS-dependent manner. This interaction on 
      the cell surface is crucial for the function of the "attachment complex" composed of 
      PorU, PorZ, and the integral OM β-barrel proteins PorV and PorQ, which is involved 
      in posttranslational modification and retention of T9SS cargos on the bacterial 
      surface.IMPORTANCE Bacteria have evolved multiple systems to transport effector 
      proteins to their surface or into the surrounding milieu. These proteins have a wide 
      range of functions, including attachment, motility, nutrient acquisition, and 
      toxicity in the host. Porphyromonas gingivalis, the human pathogen responsible for 
      severe gum diseases (periodontitis), uses a recently characterized type IX secretion 
      system (T9SS) to translocate and anchor secreted virulence effectors to the cell 
      surface. Anchorage is facilitated by sortase, an enzyme that covalently attaches 
      T9SS cargo proteins to a unique anionic lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) moiety of P. 
      gingivalis Here, we show that the T9SS component PorZ interacts with sortase and 
      specifically binds A-LPS. Binding is mediated by a phosphorylated branched mannan 
      repeat in A-LPS polysaccharide. A-LPS-bound PorZ interacts with sortase with 
      significantly higher affinity, facilitating modification of cargo proteins by the 
      cell surface attachment complex of the T9SS.

AB  - Divergent C-H functionalization reactions (arylation, carboxylation, olefination, 
      thiolation, acetoxylation, halogenation, naphthylation) using a pyridazinone moiety 
      as an internal directing group were successfully established. This approach offers a 
      late-stage, ortho-selective diversification of a biologically active pyridazinone 
      scaffold. Seven series of novel pyridazinone analogues were synthesized conveniently 
      as the synthetic precursors of potential sortase A (SrtA) inhibitors.

TI  - A structural snapshot of type II pilus formation in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
PG  - 22581-92
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.647834 [doi]
AB  - Pili are fibrous appendages expressed on the surface of a vast number of bacterial 
      species, and their role in surface adhesion is important for processes such as 
      infection, colonization, andbiofilm formation. The human pathogen Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae expresses two different types of pili, PI-1 and PI-2, both of which 
      require the concerted action of structural proteins and sortases for their 
      polymerization. The type PI-1 streptococcal pilus is a complex, well studied 
      structure, but the PI-2 type, present in a number of invasive pneumococcal 
      serotypes, has to date remained less well understood. The PI-2 pilus consists of 
      repeated units of a single protein, PitB, whose covalent association is catalyzed by 
      cognate sortase SrtG-1 and partner protein SipA. Here we report the high resolution 
      crystal structures of PitB and SrtG1 and use molecular modeling to visualize a 
      "trapped" 1:1 complex between the two molecules. X-ray crystallography and electron 
      microscopy reveal that the pneumococcal PI-2 backbone fiber is formed by PitB 
      monomers associated in head-to-tail fashion and that short, flexible fibers can be 
      formed even in the absence of coadjuvant proteins. These observations, obtained with 
      a simple pilus biosynthetic system, are likely to be applicable to other fiber 
      formation processes in a variety of Gram-positive organisms.

TI  - End-point modification of recombinant thrombomodulin with enhanced stability and 
      anticoagulant activity.

LID - S0928-0987(19)30337-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejps.2019.105066 [doi]
AB  - Thrombomodulin (TM) is an endothelial cell membrane protein that plays essential 
      roles in controlling vascular haemostatic balance. The 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domain of TM 
      (TM(456)) has cofactor activity for thrombin binding and subsequently protein C 
      activation. Therefore, recombinant TM(456) is a promising anticoagulant candidate 
      but has a very short half-life. Ligation of poly (ethylene glycol) to a bioactive 
      protein (PEGylation) is a practical choice to improve stability, extend circulating 
      life, and reduce immunogenicity of the protein. Site-specific PEGylation is 
      preferred as it could avoid the loss of protein activity resulting from nonspecific 
      modification. We report herein two site-specific PEGylation strategies, enzymatic 
      ligation and copper-free click chemistry (CFCC), for rTM(456) modification. 
      Recombinant TM(456) with a C-terminal LPETG tag (rTM(456)-LPETG) was expressed in 
      Escherichia coli for its end-point modification with NH(2)-diglycine-PEG(5000)-OMe 
      via Sortase A-mediated ligation (SML). Similarly, an azide functionality was easily 
      introduced at the C-terminus of rTM(456)-LPETG via SML with 
      NH(2)-diglycine-PEG(3)-azide, which facilitates a site-specific PEGylation of 
      rTM(456)via CFCC. Both PEGylated rTM(456) conjugates retained protein C activation 
      activity as that of rTM(456). Also, they were more stable than rTM(456) in Trypsin 
      digestion assay. Further, both PEGylated rTM(456) conjugates showed a 
      concentration-dependent prolongation of thrombin clotting time (TCT) compared to 
      non-modified protein, which confirms the effectiveness of these two site-specific 
      PEGylation schemes.

AB  - Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), a promising class of cancer biopharmaceuticals, 
      combine the specificity of therapeutic antibodies with the pharmacological potency 
      of chemical, cytotoxic drugs. Ever since the first ADCs on the market, a plethora of 
      novel ADC technologies has emerged, covering as diverse aspects as antibody 
      engineering, chemical linker optimization and novel conjugation strategies, together 
      aiming at constantly widening the therapeutic window for ADCs. This review primarily 
      focuses on novel chemical and biotechnological strategies for the site-directed 
      attachment of drugs that are currently validated for 2nd generation ADCs to promote 
      conjugate homogeneity and overall stability.

TI  - Cyclization of Single-Chain Fv Antibodies Markedly Suppressed Their Characteristic 
      Aggregation Mediated by Inter-Chain VH-VL Interactions.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24142620 [doi]
LID - 2620
AB  - Single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies are recombinant proteins in which the variable 
      regions of the heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) are connected by a short 
      flexible polypeptide linker. ScFvs have the advantages of easy genetic manipulation 
      and low-cost production using Escherichia coli compared with monoclonal antibodies, 
      and are thus expected to be utilized as next-generation medical antibodies. However, 
      the practical use of scFvs has been limited due to low homogeneity caused by their 
      aggregation propensity mediated by inter-chain VH-VL interactions. Because the 
      interactions between the VH and VL domains of antibodies are generally weak, 
      individual scFvs are assumed to be in equilibrium between a closed state and an open 
      state, in which the VH and VL domains are assembled and disassembled, respectively. 
      This dynamic feature of scFvs triggers the formation of dimer, trimer, and larger 
      aggregates caused by the inter-chain VH-VL interactions. To overcome this problem, 
      the N-terminus and C-terminus were herein connected by sortase A-mediated ligation 
      to produce a cyclic scFv. Open-closed dynamics and aggregation were markedly 
      suppressed in the cyclic scFv, as judged from dynamic light scattering and 
      high-speed atomic force microscopy analyses. Surface plasmon resonance and 
      differential scanning fluorometry analysis revealed that neither the affinity for 
      antigen nor the thermal stability was disrupted by the scFv cyclization. Generality 
      was confirmed by applying the present method to several scFv proteins. Based on 
      these results, cyclic scFvs are expected to be widely utilized in industrial and 
      therapeutic applications.

AB  - Gram-positive bacteria assemble pili (fimbriae) on their surfaces to adhere to host 
      tissues and to promote polymicrobial interactions. These hair-like structures, 
      although very thin (1 to 5 nm), exhibit impressive tensile strengths because their 
      protein components (pilins) are covalently crosslinked together via 
      lysine-isopeptide bonds by pilus-specific sortase enzymes. While atomic structures 
      of isolated pilins have been determined, how they are joined together by sortases 
      and how these interpilin crosslinks stabilize pilus structure are poorly understood. 
      Using a reconstituted pilus assembly system and hybrid structural biology methods, 
      we elucidated the solution structure and dynamics of the crosslinked interface that 
      is repeated to build the prototypical SpaA pilus from Corynebacterium diphtheriae We 
      show that sortase-catalyzed introduction of a K190-T494 isopeptide bond between 
      adjacent SpaA pilins causes them to form a rigid interface in which the LPLTG 
      sorting signal is inserted into a large binding groove. Cellular and quantitative 
      kinetic measurements of the crosslinking reaction shed light onto the mechanism of 
      pilus biogenesis. We propose that the pilus-specific sortase in C. diphtheriae uses 
      a latch mechanism to select K190 on SpaA for crosslinking in which the sorting 
      signal is partially transferred from the enzyme to a binding groove in SpaA in order 
      to facilitate catalysis. This process is facilitated by a conserved loop in SpaA, 
      which after crosslinking forms a stabilizing latch that covers the K190-T494 
      isopeptide bond. General features of the structure and sortase-catalyzed assembly 
      mechanism of the SpaA pilus are likely conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Balancing Selectivity and Efficacy of Bispecific Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 
      (EGFR) × c-MET Antibodies and Antibody-Drug Conjugates.
PG  - 25106-25119
AB  - Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have already 
      demonstrated benefits for the treatment of cancer in several clinical studies, 
      showing improved drug selectivity and efficacy. In particular, simultaneous 
      targeting of prominent cancer antigens, such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and c-MET, by 
      bsAbs has raised increasing interest for potentially circumventing receptor 
      cross-talk and c-MET-mediated acquired resistance during anti-EGFR monotherapy. In 
      this study, we combined the selectivity of EGFR × c-MET bsAbs with the potency of 
      cytotoxic agents via bispecific antibody-toxin conjugation. Affinity-attenuated 
      bispecific EGFR × c-MET antibody-drug conjugates demonstrated high in vitro 
      selectivity toward tumor cells overexpressing both antigens and potent anti-tumor 
      efficacy. Due to basal EGFR expression in the skin, ADCs targeting EGFR in general 
      warrant early safety assessments. Reduction in EGFR affinity led to decreased 
      toxicity in keratinocytes. Thus, the combination of bsAb affinity engineering with 
      the concept of toxin conjugation may be a viable route to improve the safety profile 
      of ADCs targeting ubiquitously expressed antigens.

      Streptococcus mutans Extracellular Membrane Vesicle Biogenesis.
PG  - 570219
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.570219 [doi]
LID - 570219
AB  - Extracellular membrane vesicles (EMVs) are produced by many Gram-positive organisms, 
      but information regarding vesiculogenesis is incomplete. We used single gene 
      deletions to evaluate the impacts on Streptococcus mutans EMV biogenesis of Sortase 
      A (SrtA), which affects S. mutans EMV composition, and Sfp, a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl 
      transferase that affects Bacillus subtilis EMV stability. ΔsrtA EMVs were notably 
      larger than Δsfp and wild-type (WT) EMVs. EMV proteins identified from all three 
      strains are known to be involved in cell wall biogenesis and cell architecture, 
      bacterial adhesion, biofilm cell density and matrix development, and microbial 
      competition. Notably, the AtlA autolysin was not processed to its mature active form 
      in the ΔsrtA mutant. Proteomic and lipidomic analyses of all three strains revealed 
      multiple dissimilarities between vesicular and corresponding cytoplasmic membranes 
      (CMs). A higher proportion of EMV proteins are predicted substrates of the general 
      secretion pathway (GSP). Accordingly, the GSP component SecA was identified as a 
      prominent EMV-associated protein. In contrast, CMs contained more multi-pass 
      transmembrane (TM) protein substrates of co-translational transport machineries than 
      EMVs. EMVs from the WT, but not the mutant strains, were enriched in cardiolipin 
      compared to CMs, and all EMVs were over-represented in polyketide flavonoids. EMVs 
      and CMs were rich in long-chain saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids, except for Δsfp EMVs that contained exclusively polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids. Lipoproteins were less prevalent in EMVs of all three strains compared to 
      their CMs. This study provides insight into biophysical characteristics of S. mutans 
      EMVs and indicates discrete partitioning of protein and lipid components between 
      EMVs and corresponding CMs of WT, ΔsrtA, and Δsfp strains.

TI  - Does Curcumin Have an Anticaries Effect? A Systematic Review of In Vitro Studies.
PG  - 213-227
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-56153-6_12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental caries is one of the most important oral health problems and a 
      common infectious microbial disease. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) has been 
      regarded as the primary etiologic factor in the formation of dental caries. Curcumin 
      (CUR) has an antibacterial action and could be used in the eradication of S. mutans 
      to control dental caries. This systematic review was undertaken with the aim of 
      evaluating the anticaries effect of CUR. METHODS: A comprehensive search was 
      conducted in the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane - CENTRAL, and Scopus databases. Based on 
      the PICO model, studies which evaluated the anticaries effects of CUR up until 24 
      February 2020 with language restrictions were selected for this systematic review. 
      RESULTS: From 753 papers found, 13 met the eligibility criteria and were included. 
      In 12 out of 13 included studies, CUR had significant antibacterial and anticaries 
      effects. CUR had inhibitory effects on S. mutans growth, acid production, ATPase and 
      sortase A activity, biomass, viability and metabolism reduction of biofilm, reduced 
      exopolysaccharide production of biofilms, changes in biofilm structure, and had 
      anti-adhesion effects against S. mutans. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests 
      promising antibacterial and anticaries effects of CUR including inhibition of S. 
      mutans growth, acid production, ATPase and sortase A activity. This review provides 
      unique information regarding the potential role of CUR in the prevention and 
      treatment of dental carries as a natural, accessible, safe, and inexpensive agent to 
      increase oral and dental health. However, clinical randomized controlled trials are 
      needed to confirm these results.

AB  - Identification of tumors which over-express Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) 
      is important in selecting patients for anti-EGFR therapies. Enzymatic bioconjugation 
      was used to introduce positron-emitting radionuclides ((89)Zr, (64)Cu) into an 
      anti-EGFR antibody fragment for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging the same 
      day as injection. A monovalent antibody fragment with high affinity for EGFR was 
      engineered to include a sequence that is recognized by the transpeptidase sortase A. 
      Two different metal chelators, one for (89)Zr(IV) and one for (64)Cu(II), were 
      modified with a N-terminal glycine to enable them to act as substrates in sortase A 
      mediated bioconjugation to the antibody fragment. Both fragments provided 
      high-quality PET images of EGFR positive tumors in a mouse model at 3 hours 
      post-injection, a significant advantage when compared to radiolabeled full 
      antibodies that require several days between injection of the tracer and imaging. 
      The use of enzymatic bioconjugation gives reproducible homogeneous products with the 
      metal complexes selectively installed on the C-terminus of the antibody potentially 
      simplifying regulatory approval.

TI  - Bovine and human lactoferricin peptides: chimeras and new cyclic analogs.
PG  - 935-48
LID - 10.1007/s10534-014-9753-4 [doi]
AB  - Lactoferrin (LF) is an important antimicrobial and immune regulatory protein present 
      in neutrophils and most exocrine secretions of mammals. The antimicrobial activity 
      of LF has been related to the presence of an antimicrobial peptide sequence, called 
      lactoferricin (LFcin), located in the N-terminal region of the protein. The 
      antimicrobial activity of bovine LFcin is considerably stronger than the human 
      version. In this work, chimera peptides combining segments of bovine and human LFcin 
      were generated in order to study their antimicrobial activity and mechanism of 
      action. In addition, the relevance of the conserved disulfide bridge and the 
      resulting cyclic structure of both LFcins were analyzed by using "click chemistry" 
      and sortase A-catalyzed cyclization of the peptides. The N-terminal region of bovine 
      LFcin (residues 17-25 of bovine LF) proved to be very important for the 
      antimicrobial activity of the chimera peptides against E. coli, when combined with 
      the C-terminal region of human LFcin. Similarly the cyclic bovine LFcin analogs 
      generated by "click chemistry" and sortase A preserved the antimicrobial activity of 
      the original peptide, showing the significance of these two techniques in the design 
      of cyclic antimicrobial peptides. The mechanism of action of bovine LFcin and its 
      active derived peptides was strongly correlated with membrane leakage in E. coli and 
      up to some extent with the ability to induce vesicle aggregation. This mechanism was 
      also preserved under conditions of high ionic strength (150 mM NaCl) illustrating 
      the importance of these peptides in a more physiologically relevant system.

TI  - Marine Fungal Cerebroside Flavuside B Protects HaCaT Keratinocytes against 
      Staphylococcus aureus Induced Damage.
LID - 10.3390/md19100553 [doi]
LID - 553
AB  - Cerebrosides are glycosylated sphingolipids, and in mammals they contribute to the 
      pro-/anti-inflammatory properties and innate antimicrobial activity of the skin and 
      mucosal surfaces. Staphylococcus aureus infection can develop, not only from minor 
      scratches of the skin, but this pathogen can also actively promote epithelial 
      breach. The effect of cerebroside flavuside B from marine sediment-derived fungus 
      Penicillium islandicum (Aniva Bay, the Sea of Okhotsk) on viability, apoptosis, 
      total caspase activity, and cell cycle in human epidermal keratinocytes HaCaT line 
      co-cultivated with S. aureus, as well as influence of flavuside B on LPS-treated 
      HaCaT cells were studied. Influence of flavuside B on bacterial growth and biofilm 
      formation of S. aureus and its effect on the enzymatic activity of sortase A was 
      also investigated. It was found S. aureus co-cultivated with keratinocytes induces 
      caspase-depended apoptosis and cell death, arrest cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, and 
      increases in cellular immune inflammation. Cerebroside flavuside B has demonstrated 
      its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, substantially eliminating all 
      the negative consequences caused by co-cultivation of keratinocytes with S. aureus 
      or bacterial LPS. The dual action of flavuside B may be highly effective in the 
      treatment of bacterial skin lesions and will be studied in the future in in vivo 
      experiments.

      Although various methods have been developed to prepare macrocycles, a general and 
      efficient strategy is needed. Here we report a highly efficient method using 
      butelase 1 to macrocyclize peptides and proteins ranging in sizes from 26 to >200 
      residues. We achieved cyclizations that are 20,000 times faster than sortase A, the 
      most widely used ligase for protein cyclization. The reactions completed within 
      minutes with up to 95% yields.

AB  - A fundamental step of Gram-positive pathogenesis is the bacterial adhesion to the 
      host tissue involving interaction between bacterial surface molecules and host 
      ligands. This review is focused on antivirulence compounds that target Gram-positive 
      adhesins and on their potential development as therapeutic agents alternative or 
      complementary to conventional antibiotics in the contrast of pathogens. In 
      particular, compounds that target the sortase A, wall theicoic acid inhibitors, 
      carbohydrates able to bind bacterial proteins and proteins capable of influencing 
      the bacterial adhesion, were described. We further discuss the advantages and 
      disadvantages of this strategy in the development of novel antimicrobials and the 
      future perspective of this research field still at its first steps.

AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus is an emerging cause of infective endocarditis that has 
      been epidemiologically linked to colorectal cancer. S. gallolyticus is poorly 
      transformable using electroporation and no defined mutant has been published yet. 
      Hence, we used mobilization to introduce plasmid DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae 
      into S. gallolyticus using the transfer origin of the conjugative element TnGBS1 
      (oriTTnGBS1), followed by a classical homologous recombination technique. Two 
      isogenic mutants of S. gallolyticus UCN34, one deleted for the pil1 pilus operon and 
      another for the sortase A gene, were constructed and characterized. This genetic 
      tool should help in unravelling virulence mechanisms of this bacterium.

TI  - A Narrative Review on the Role of Staphylococcus aureus Bacteriuria in S. aureus 
      Bacteremia.
PG  - ofab158
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofab158 [doi]
LID - ofab158
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus bacteriuria (SABU) can occur in patients with S. aureus 
      bacteremia (SAB). However, little is known on the (molecular) pathomechanisms of the 
      renal passage of S. aureus. This review discusses the epidemiology and pathogenesis 
      of SABU in patients with SAB and identifies knowledge gaps. The literature search 
      was restricted to the English language. The prevalence of SABU in patients with SAB 
      is 7.8%-39% depending on the study design. The main risk factor for SABU is urinary 
      tract catheterization. SABU in SAB patients is associated with increased mortality. 
      Given present evidence, hematogenous seeding-as seen in animal models-and the 
      development of micro-abscesses best describe the translocation of S. aureus from 
      blood to urine. Virulence factors that might be involved are adhesion factors, 
      sortase A, and coagulase, among others. Other potential routes of bacterial 
      translocation (eg, transcytosis, paracytosis, translocation via "Trojan horses") 
      were identified as knowledge gaps.

AB  - Copper-mediated direct ortho-C-H amination of arenes has been accomplished with the 
      aid of easily removable bidentate pyridine N-oxide as a directing group. The use of 
      free cyclic secondary amines and anilines as aminating agents and inexpensive copper 
      acetate makes the strategy more effective and favorable from the economic point of 
      view. This reaction is compatible with a wide range of functional groups to 
      synthesize a variety of amine-containing products of high interest. This method also 
      allows the short synthesis of the central scaffold of pharmaceutically relevant 
      Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A inhibitors.

TI  - MRI Based Localisation and Quantification of Abscesses following Experimental S.

PG  - e0154705
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0154705 [doi]
LID - e0154705
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and validate a sensitive and specific method of abscess 
      enumeration and quantification in a preclinical model of Staphylococcus aureus 
      infection. METHODS: S. aureus infected murine kidneys were fixed in 
      paraformaldehyde, impregnated with gadolinium, and embedded in agar blocks, which 
      were subjected to 3D magnetic resonance microscopy on a 9.4T MRI scanner. Image 
      analysis techniques were developed, which could identify and quantify abscesses. The 
      result of this imaging was compared with histological examination. The impact of a 
      S. aureus Sortase A vaccination regime was assessed using the technique. RESULTS: Up 
      to 32 murine kidneys could be imaged in a single MRI run, yielding images with 
      voxels of about 25 μm3. S. aureus abscesses could be readily identified in blinded 
      analyses of the kidneys after 3 days of infection, with low inter-observer 
      variability. Comparison with histological sections shows a striking correlation 
      between the two techniques: all presumptive abscesses identified by MRI were 
      confirmed histologically, and histology identified no abscesses not evident on MRI. 
      In view of this, simulations were performed assuming that both MRI reconstruction, 
      and histology examining all sections of the tissue, were fully sensitive and 
      specific at abscess detection. This simulation showed that MRI provided more 
      sensitive and precise estimates of abscess numbers and volume than histology, unless 
      at least 5 histological sections are taken through the long axis of the kidney. We 
      used the MRI technique described to investigate the impact of a S. aureus Sortase A 
      vaccine. CONCLUSION: Post mortem MRI scanning of large batches of fixed organs has 
      application in the preclinical assessment of S. aureus vaccines.

LID - 10.1039/c7sc02721d [doi]
AB  - Agents with novel mechanisms of action are needed to complement traditional 
      antibiotics. Towards these goals, we have exploited the surface-homing properties of 
      vancomycin to tag the surface of Gram-positive pathogens with immune cell 
      attractants in two unique modes. First, vancomycin was conjugated to the small 
      molecule hapten 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) to promote bacterial opsonization. Second, 
      we built on these results by improving the tagging specificity and mechanism of 
      incorporation by coupling it to a sortase A substrate peptide. We demonstrated, for 
      the first time, that the surface of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can be 
      metabolically labeled in live Caenorhabditis elegans hosts. These constructs 
      represent a class of promising narrow-spectrum agents that target S. aureus for 
      opsonization and establish a new surface labeling modality in live host organisms, 
      which should be a powerful tool in dissecting features of host-pathogen 
      interactions.

TI  - Flavonols inhibit sortases and sortase-mediated Staphylococcus aureus clumping to 
      fibrinogen.
PG  - 1751-5
AB  - Sortases are a family of Gram-positive transpeptidases responsible for anchoring 
      surface protein virulence factors to the peptidoglycan cell wall layer. In 
      Staphylococcus aureus, deletion of the sortase isoforms results in marked reduction 
      in virulence and infection potential, making it an important antivirulence target. 
      We examined the effects of naturally occurring flavonols on recombinant sortase A 
      (SrtA) and B (SrtB) prepared from S. aureus ATCC6538p and found that these compounds 
      inhibited the activity of sortases, without exhibiting antibacterial activities. 
      Among the flavonols tested, morin, myricetin, and quercetin exhibited strong sortase 
      inhibitory activities (SrtA IC50: 37.39-52.70 microM, SrtB IC50: 8.54-36.89 microM). 
      The fibrinogen cell-clumping activity data highlight the potential of flavonols for 
      the treatment of S. aureus infections via inhibition of sortase.

AB  - The site-specific conjugation of DNA-binding protein (Tus) to self-assembling 
      peptide FEFEFKFKK was demonstrated. Rheology studies and TEM of the corresponding 
      hydrogels (including PNIPAAm-containing systems) showed no significant variation in 
      properties and hydrogel morphology compared to FEFEFKFKK. Critically, we demonstrate 
      that Tus is accessible within the gel network displaying DNA-binding properties.

AB  - A one-pot strategy combining sortase A mediated on-resin peptide cleavage and in 
      situ cyclization was developed for the synthesis of cyclic peptides. This strategy 
      was applied to synthesize head-to-tail cyclic antibacterial bovine lactoferricin 
      peptide LFcinB(20-35) in a yield of 67%. The one-pot strategy was compatible with an 
      oxidative folding reaction, and complex cyclotides containing one or two disulfide 
      bonds, such as sunflower trypsin inhibitors-1 and α-conotoxin MII, were successfully 
      synthesized in one pot in a yield of 77% and 61%, respectively.

TI  - Covalent sortase A inhibitor ML346 prevents Staphylococcus aureus infection of 
      Galleria mellonella.
PG  - 138-149
LID - 10.1039/d1md00316j [doi]
AB  - The housekeeping sortase A (SrtA), a membrane-associated cysteine transpeptidase, is 
      responsible for anchoring surface proteins to the cell wall peptidoglycan in 
      Gram-positive bacteria. This process is essential for the regulation of bacterial 
      virulence and pathogenicity. Therefore, SrtA is considered to be an ideal target for 
      antivirulence therapy. In this study, we report that ML346, a compound with a 
      barbituric acid and cinnamaldehyde scaffold, functions as an irreversible inhibitor 
      of Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA) and Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) in 
      vitro at low micromolar concentrations. According to our X-ray crystal structure of 
      the SpSrtA(ΔN81)/ML346 complex (Protein Data Bank ID: 7V6K), ML346 covalently 
      modifies the thiol group of Cys208 in the active site of SpSrtA. Importantly, ML346 
      significantly attenuated the virulence phenotypes of S. aureus and exhibited 
      inhibitory effects on Galleria mellonella larva infection caused by S. aureus. 
      Collectively, our results indicate that ML346 has potential for development as a 
      covalent antivirulence agent for treating S. aureus infections, including 
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis: distinct mechanisms of bacterial adhesion to 
      damaged and inflamed heart valves.
PG  - 3248-3259
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehz175 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The pathogenesis of endocarditis is not well understood resulting in 
      unsuccessful attempts at prevention. Clinical observations suggest that 
      Staphylococcus aureus infects either damaged or inflamed heart valves. Using a newly 
      developed endocarditis mouse model, we therefore studied the initial adhesion of S. 
      aureus in both risk states. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using 3D confocal microscopy, we 
      examined the adhesion of fluorescent S. aureus to murine aortic valves. To mimic 
      different risk states we either damaged the valves with a surgically placed catheter 
      or simulated valve inflammation by local endothelium activation. We used von 
      Willebrand factor (VWF) gene-deficient mice, induced platelet and fibrinogen 
      depletion and used several S. aureus mutant strains to investigate the contribution 
      of both host and bacterial factors in early bacterial adhesion. Both cardiac valve 
      damage and inflammation predisposed to endocarditis, but by distinct mechanisms. 
      Following valve damage, S. aureus adhered directly to VWF and fibrin, deposited on 
      the damaged valve. This was mediated by Sortase A-dependent adhesins such as 
      VWF-binding protein and Clumping factor A. Platelets did not contribute. In 
      contrast, upon cardiac valve inflammation, widespread endothelial activation led to 
      endothelial cell-bound VWF release. This recruited large amounts of platelets, 
      capturing S. aureus to the valve surface. Here, neither fibrinogen, nor Sortase A 
      were essential. CONCLUSION: Cardiac valve damage and inflammation predispose to S. 
      aureus endocarditis via distinct mechanisms. These findings may have important 
      implications for the development of new preventive strategies, as some interventions 
      might be effective in one risk state, but not in the other.

TI  - Anti-human PD-L1 Nanobody for Immuno-PET Imaging: Validation of a Conjugation 
      Strategy for Clinical Translation.
LID - 10.3390/biom10101388 [doi]
LID - 1388
AB  - Immune checkpoints, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), limit T-cell function 
      and tumor cells use this ligand to escape the anti-tumor immune response. Treatments 
      with monoclonal antibodies blocking these checkpoints have shown long-lasting 
      responses, but only in a subset of patients. This study aims to develop a Nanobody 
      (Nb)-based probe in order to assess human PD-L1 (hPD-L1) expression using positron 
      emission tomography imaging, and to compare the influence of two different 
      radiolabeling strategies, since the Nb has a lysine in its complementarity 
      determining region (CDR), which may impact its affinity upon functionalization. The 
      Nb has been conjugated with the NOTA chelator site-specifically via the Sortase-A 
      enzyme or randomly on its lysines. [(68)Ga]Ga-NOTA-(hPD-L1) Nbs were obtained in 
      >95% radiochemical purity. In vivo tumor targeting studies at 1 h 20 post-injection 
      revealed specific tumor uptake of 1.89 ± 0.40%IA/g for the site-specific conjugate, 
      1.77 ± 0.29%IA/g for the random conjugate, no nonspecific organ targeting, and 
      excretion via the kidneys and bladder. Both strategies allowed for easily obtaining 
      (68)Ga-labeled hPD-L1 Nbs in high yields. The two conjugates were stable and showed 
      excellent in vivo targeting. Moreover, we proved that the random lysine-conjugation 
      is a valid strategy for clinical translation of the hPD-L1 Nb, despite the lysine 
      present in the CDR.

AB  - Single-chain protein affinity ligands are recombinant polypeptides that recreate the 
      antigen-binding site of parental, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or present unique 
      binding surfaces derived from display technologies, computational design, or other 
      approaches. These diverse ligands have several advantages over full-length mAbs as 
      agents for delivery of small molecule, protein, and nanoparticle cargoes to desired 
      sites in the body. However, they present unique challenges for modification and 
      bioconjugation. Fusion of a LPXTGG motif, or "sortag," and a 5-amino acid, flexible 
      linker to the C-terminus of these affinity ligands enables high-efficiency 
      transpeptidation by the bacterial enzyme, Sortase A, and site-specific addition of 
      fluorophores, radiolabels, or functional groups for oriented and stoichiometrically 
      controlled bioconjugation. We describe in detail this method and address several 
      challenges and pitfalls in the purification and characterization of modified 
      single-chain affinity ligands.

TI  - GPR107, a G-protein-coupled receptor essential for intoxication by Pseudomonas

LID - 10.1074/jbc.M114.589275 [doi]
AB  - A number of toxins, including exotoxin A (PE) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, kill cells 
      by inhibiting protein synthesis. PE kills by ADP-ribosylation of the translation 
      elongation factor 2, but many of the host factors required for entry, membrane 
      translocation, and intracellular transport remain to be elucidated. A genome-wide 
      genetic screen in human KBM7 cells was performed to uncover host factors used by PE, 
      several of which were confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing in a different cell 
      type. Several proteins not previously implicated in the PE intoxication pathway were 
      identified, including GPR107, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor. GPR107 localizes 
      to the trans-Golgi network and is essential for retrograde transport. It is cleaved 
      by the endoprotease furin, and a disulfide bond connects the two cleaved fragments. 
      Compromising this association affects the function of GPR107. The N-terminal region 
      of GPR107 is critical for its biological function. GPR107 might be one of the 
      long-sought receptors that associates with G-proteins to regulate intracellular 
      vesicular transport.

TI  - Interrogation of 3D-swapped structure and functional attributes of quintessential 
      Sortase A from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
LID - BCJ20200631 [pii]
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20200631 [doi]
AB  - The anchoring of the surface proteins to the cell wall in gram-positive bacteria 
      involves a peptide ligation reaction catalyzed by transpeptidase sortase. Most 
      bacterial genomes encode multiple sortases with dedicated functions. Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (Sp) carries four sortases; a housekeeping sortase (SrtA), and three 
      pilin specific sortases (SrtC1, C2, C3) dedicated to the biosynthesis of covalent 
      pilus. Interestingly, SrtA, meant for performing housekeeping roles, is also 
      implicated in pilus assembly of Sp. The allegiance of SpSrtA to the pathogenic pilus 
      assembly makes it an ideal target for clinical inhibitor development. In this paper, 
      we describe biochemical characterization, crystal structure and peptide substrate 
      preference of SpSrtA. Transpeptidation reaction with a variety of substrates 
      revealed that the enzyme preferred elongated LPXTG sequences and transferred them 
      equally well to both Ala- and Gly-terminated peptides. Curiously, crystal structure 
      of both wild type and an active site (Cys to Ala) mutant of SpSrtA displayed 
      inter-twined 3D-swapped dimers in which each protomer generated a classic eight 
      stranded beta-barrel "sortase fold". Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation 
      equilibrium measurements revealed predominant presence of a dimer in equilibrium 
      with its monomer. The crystal structure-based Cys-Cys distance mapping with defined 
      chemical cross-linkers established the existence of 3D-swapped structure in 
      solution. The swapping in SpSrtA, unprecedented for sortase family, may be 
      physiologically relevant and meant to perform regulatory functions.

TI  - Recent advances in covalent, site-specific protein immobilization.
LID - F1000 Faculty Rev-2303 [pii]
AB  - The properties of biosensors, biomedical implants, and other materials based on 
      immobilized proteins greatly depend on the method employed to couple the protein 
      molecules to their solid support. Covalent, site-specific immobilization strategies 
      are robust and can provide the level of control that is desired in this kind of 
      application. Recent advances include the use of enzymes, such as sortase A, to 
      couple proteins in a site-specific manner to materials such as microbeads, glass, 
      and hydrogels. Also, self-labeling tags such as the SNAP-tag can be employed. Last 
      but not least, chemical approaches based on bioorthogonal reactions, like the 
      azide-alkyne cycloaddition, have proven to be powerful tools. The lack of 
      comparative studies and quantitative analysis of these immobilization methods 
      hampers the selection process of the optimal strategy for a given application. 
      However, besides immobilization efficiency, the freedom in selecting the site of 
      conjugation and the size of the conjugation tag and the researcher's expertise 
      regarding molecular biology and/or chemical techniques will be determining factors 
      in this regard.

TI  - Evaluation of Staphylococcus aureus virulence factors using a silkworm model.
PG  - 116-24
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02439.x [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have indicated that the silkworm model is useful for identifying 
      virulence genes of Staphylococcus aureus, a human pathogenic bacterium. Here we 
      examined the scope of S. aureus virulence factors that can be evaluated using the 
      silkworm model. Gene-disrupted mutants of the agr locus, arlS gene and saeS gene, 
      which regulate the expression of cell surface adhesins and hemolysins, exhibited 
      attenuated virulence in silkworms. Mutants of the hla gene encoding α-hemolysin, the 
      hlb gene encoding β-hemolysin, and the psmα and psmβ operons encoding cytolysins, 
      however, showed virulence in silkworms indistinguishable from that of the parent 
      strain. Thus, these S. aureus cytolysins are not required for virulence in 
      silkworms. In contrast, the gene-disrupted mutants of clfB, fnbB and sdrC, which 
      encode cell-wall-anchored proteins, attenuated S. aureus virulence in silkworms. In 
      addition, the mutant of the srtA gene encoding sortase A, which anchors cell-wall 
      proteins, showed attenuated virulence in silkworms. These findings suggest that the 
      silkworm model can be used to evaluate S. aureus cell-wall proteins and regulatory 
      proteins as virulence factors.

AB  - Progress of synthetic methods using ligation makes it possible to access larger and 
      multifunctionalized biomolecules. Recently, sortase-mediated ligation was used as a 
      new and complementary technique for construction of peptide and protein to other 
      ligation methods. Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A (SrtA) is a transpeptidase that 
      recognizes C-terminal LPXTG motif of proteins to cleave between T and G, and 
      subsequently transfers the acyl component to a nucleophile containing N-terminal 
      oligo-glycines. Toward development of multi- and heteroglycosylated protein 
      synthesis, we utilized SrtA-mediated ligation technique for preparation of 
      MUC1-related glycopeptide analogs having both N- and O-glycans as model compounds. 
      To further improve this synthetic strategy, we also demonstrated the merits of 
      SrtA-mediated ligation by means of a polymer-supported protocol. The present 
      strategy will facilitate rapid and large-scale synthesis of multiply functionalized 
      neoglycoprotein as new types of convenient models for the investigation of 
      structure-function relationship.

TI  - Surface Proteins of Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.GPP3-0046-2018 [doi]
AB  - The surface of Staphylococcus aureus is decorated with over 20 proteins that are 
      covalently anchored to peptidoglycan by the action of sortase A. These cell 
      wall-anchored (CWA) proteins can be classified into several structural and 
      functional groups. The largest is the MSCRAMM family, which is characterized by 
      tandemly repeated IgG-like folded domains that bind peptide ligands by the dock lock 
      latch mechanism or the collagen triple helix by the collagen hug. Several CWA 
      proteins comprise modules that have different functions, and some individual domains 
      can bind different ligands, sometimes by different mechanisms. For example, the 
      N-terminus of the fibronectin binding proteins comprises an MSCRAMM domain which 
      binds several ligands, while the C-terminus is composed of tandem fibronectin 
      binding repeats. Surface proteins promote adhesion to host cells and tissue, 
      including components of the extracellular matrix, contribute to biofilm formation by 
      stimulating attachment to the host or indwelling medical devices followed by 
      cell-cell accumulation via homophilic interactions between proteins on neighboring 
      cells, help bacteria evade host innate immune responses, participate in iron 
      acquisition from host hemoglobin, and trigger invasion of bacteria into cells that 
      are not normally phagocytic. The study of genetically manipulated strains using 
      animal infection models has shown that many CWA proteins contribute to pathogenesis. 
      Fragments of CWA proteins have the potential to be used in multicomponent vaccines 
      to prevent S. aureus infections.

PG  - 191-203
LID - 10.1016/j.crstbi.2020.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Studies of protein allostery increasingly reveal an involvement of the back and 
      forth order-disorder transitions in this mechanism of protein activity regulation. 
      Here, we investigate the allosteric mechanisms mediated by structural disorder using 
      the structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery (SBSMMA) that we have 
      previously developed. We show that SBSMMA accounts for the energetics and causality 
      of allosteric communication underlying dimerization of the BirA biotin repressor, 
      activation of the sortase A enzyme, and inhibition of the Rac1 GTPase. Using the 
      SBSMMA, we also show that introducing structural order or disorder in various 
      regions of esterases can originate tunable allosteric modulation of the catalytic 
      triad. On the basis of obtained results, we propose that operating with the 
      order-disorder continuum allows one to establish an allosteric control scale for 
      achieving desired modulation of the protein activity.

AB  - Introducing unique functional group into protein is an attractive approach for 
      site-selective protein modification applications. In this report, we systemically 
      investigated four site-selective strategies to introduce azide functionality into 
      recombinant thrombomodulin (TM456), via direct recombinant expression with unnatural 
      amino acid, chemical, and enzymatic modification for its bio-orthogonal modification 
      application. First, a straightforward recombinant method to express TM456 with azide 
      functionality near C-terminus by replacing methionine with azidohomoanlanine from 
      methionine auxotroph Escherichia coli cell was investigated. Next, a 
      sortase-mediated ligation (SML) method to incorporate azide functionality into the 
      C-terminus of recombinant TM456 was demonstrated. The third is to add azide 
      functionality to the N-terminal amine of recombinant TM456via amidation chemistry, 
      and the fourth is tyrosine selective three-component Mannich reaction to introduce 
      azide functionality to recombinant TM456. Overall, SML of recombinant protein 
      affords the highest overall yield for incorporating azide functionality into the 
      C-terminus recombinant TM456 since the key protein expression step uses natural 
      amino acids. Also, single site modification facilitates the highest TM456 activity.

TI  - Vaccine protection of leukopenic mice against Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream 
      infection.
PG  - 4889-98
LID - 10.1128/IAI.02328-14 [doi]
AB  - The risk for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (BSI) is increased in 
      immunocompromised individuals, including patients with hematologic malignancy and/or 
      chemotherapy. Due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, designated 
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), staphylococcal BSI in cancer patients is 
      associated with high mortality; however, neither a protective vaccine nor 
      pathogen-specific immunotherapy is currently available. Here, we modeled 
      staphylococcal BSI in leukopenic CD-1 mice that had been treated with 
      cyclophosphamide, a drug for leukemia and lymphoma patients. 
      Cyclophosphamide-treated mice were highly sensitive to S. aureus BSI and developed 
      infectious lesions lacking immune cell infiltrates. Virulence factors of S. aureus 
      that are key for disease establishment in immunocompetent hosts-α-hemolysin (Hla), 
      iron-regulated surface determinants (IsdA and IsdB), coagulase (Coa), and von 
      Willebrand factor binding protein (vWbp)-are dispensable for the pathogenesis of BSI 
      in leukopenic mice. In contrast, sortase A mutants, which cannot assemble surface 
      proteins, display delayed time to death and increased survival in this model. A 
      vaccine with four surface antigens (ClfA, FnBPB, SdrD, and SpAKKAA), which was 
      identified by genetic vaccinology using sortase A mutants, raised antigen-specific 
      immune responses that protected leukopenic mice against staphylococcal BSI.

AB  - The recent advancement of peptide macrocycles as promising therapeutics creates a 
      need for novel methodologies for their efficient synthesis and (large scale) 
      production. Within this context, due to the favorable properties of biocatalysts, 
      enzyme-mediated methodologies have gained great interest. Enzymes such as sortase A, 
      butelase 1, peptiligase and omniligase-1 represent extremely powerful and valuable 
      enzymatic tools for peptide ligation, since they can be applied to generate complex 
      cyclic peptides with exquisite biological activity. Therefore, the use of enzymatic 
      strategies will effectively supplement the scope of existing chemical methodologies 
      and will accelerate the development of future cyclic peptide therapeutics. The 
      advantages and disadvantages of the different enzymatic methodologies will be 
      discussed in this review.

AB  - Small ligands specific to tumor-associated antigens can be used as alternatives to 
      antibodies for the delivery of small payloads such as radionuclides, cytotoxic 
      drugs, and fluorophores. Their use as a delivery moiety of bioactive proteins such 
      as cytokines remains largely unexplored. Here, we describe the preparation and in 
      vivo characterization of the first small molecule-cytokine conjugate targeting 
      carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a marker of renal cell carcinoma and hypoxia. 
      Site-specific conjugation between interleukin-2 and acetazolamide was obtained by 
      sortase A-mediated transpeptidation. Binding of the conjugate to the cognate CAIX 
      antigen was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. The in vivo targeting of 
      structures expressing carbonic anhydrase IX was assessed by biodistribution 
      experiments in tumor-bearing mice. Optimization of manufacturability and 
      tumor-targeting performance of acetazolamide-cytokine products will be required in 
      order to enable industrial applications.

      Peptides, Glycopeptides, and Proteins.
PG  - 366-383
AB  - Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchorage of proteins and glycoproteins onto the 
      cell surface is ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and GPI-anchored proteins and 
      glycoproteins play an important role in many biological processes. To study GPI 
      anchorage and explore the functions of GPIs and GPI-anchored proteins and 
      glycoproteins, it is essential to have access to these molecules in homogeneous and 
      structurally defined forms. This review is focused on the progress that our 
      laboratory has made towards the chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis of 
      structurally defined GPI anchors and GPI-anchored peptides, glycopeptides, and 
      proteins. Briefly, highly convergent strategies were developed for GPI synthesis and 
      were employed to successfully synthesize a number of GPIs, including those carrying 
      unsaturated lipids and other useful functionalities such as the azido and alkynyl 
      groups. The latter enabled further site-specific modification of GPIs by click 
      chemistry. GPI-linked peptides, glycopeptides, and proteins were prepared by 
      regioselective chemical coupling of properly protected GPIs and 
      peptides/glycopeptides or through site-specific ligation of synthetic GPIs and 
      peptides/glycopeptides/proteins under the influence of sortase A. The investigation 
      of interactions between GPI anchors and pore-forming bacterial toxins by means of 
      synthetic GPI anchors and GPI analogs is also discussed.

AB  - A new convergent chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy, integrating enzymatic synthesis 
      of heparan sulfate, sortase A ligation, copper(i)-catalyzed alkyne-azide 
      cycloaddition, and solid phase peptide synthesis, has been established to 
      efficiently synthesize a mimetic of heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 
      glyco-polypeptide at a milligram scale. The mimic was able to bind with αvβ3 
      integrin faster and exhibit stronger inhibition of breast cancer cell migration 
      compared to the glycan or the polypeptide alone. This novel approach could serve as 
      a general approach for heparan sulfate proteoglycan mimetic synthesis.

AB  - On-target, cell-active chemical probes are of fundamental importance in chemical and 
      cell biology, whereas poorly characterized probes often lead to invalid conclusions. 
      Human N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) has attracted increasing interest as target in 
      cancer and infectious diseases. Here we report an in-depth comparison of five 
      compounds widely applied as human NMT inhibitors, using a combination of 
      quantitative whole-proteome N-myristoylation profiling, biochemical enzyme assays, 
      cytotoxicity, in-cell protein synthesis, and cell-cycle assays. We find that 
      N-myristoylation is unaffected by 2-hydroxymyristic acid (100 μM), D-NMAPPD (30 μM), 
      or Tris-DBA palladium (10 μM), with the latter compounds causing cytotoxicity 
      through mechanisms unrelated to NMT. In contrast, drug-like inhibitors IMP-366 
      (DDD85646) and IMP-1088 delivered complete and specific inhibition of 
      N-myristoylation in a range of cell lines at 1 μM and 100 nM, respectively. This 
      study enables the selection of appropriate on-target probes for future studies and 
      suggests the need for reassessment of previous studies that used off-target 
      compounds.

TI  - Sortase-mediated chemical protein synthesis reveals the bidentate binding of 
      bisphosphorylated p62 with K63 diubiquitin.
PG  - 6881-6887
LID - 10.1039/c7sc02937c [doi]
AB  - Phosphorylation of S403 or S407 of the autophagic receptor protein p62 has recently 
      been discovered to enhance the binding of p62 with ubiquitinated protein substrates 
      to upregulate selective autophagy. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of how 
      phosphorylation regulates the recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins, we report the 
      first chemical synthesis of homogeneously phosphorylated p62, which enables the 
      setting up of accurate in vitro systems for biochemical studies. Our synthesis 
      employs the technology of sortase A-mediated protein hydrazide ligation, which 
      successfully affords three types of phosphorylated p62 at the multi-milligram scale. 
      Quantitative biochemical measurements show that the binding affinity of 
      S403/S407-bisphosphorylated p62 to K63 diubiquitin is significantly higher than that 
      of mono-phosphorylated p62. This finding suggests that phosphorylated S403 and S407 
      sites should bind to different epitopes on the ubiquitin chain. Furthermore, 
      glutamate mutation is found to give a significantly impaired binding affinity, 
      implying the necessity of using chemically synthesized phosphorylated p62 for the 
      biochemical study of selective autophagy.

AB  - Herein, we report a novel two-step method for the covalent, site-directed, and 
      efficient immobilization of proteins on lab-made paper sheets. First, paper fibers 
      were modified with a peptidic anchor comprising enzyme recognition motifs. Four 
      different conjugation strategies for peptide immobilization were evaluated with 
      respect to reproducibility and fiber loading efficiency. After manufacturing of the 
      peptide-preconditioned paper, oriented conjugation of the model protein tGFP 
      containing a C-terminal recognition sequence for either sortase A or microbial 
      transglutaminase was assessed semiquantitatively by fluorescence measurement and 
      inspected by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The two enzymes utilized for 
      protein conjugation used the same oligoglycine peptide anchor, and both proved to be 
      suitable for controlled oriented linkage of substrate proteins at physiological 
      conditions.

LID - 10.1039/c7bm00691h [doi]
AB  - Stiffening of the extracellular matrix is a hallmark in cancer progression, 
      embryonic development, and wound healing. To mimic this dynamic process, our work 
      explored orthogonal enzymatic reactions capable of modulating the properties of 
      poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-peptide hydrogels. A hepta-mutant bacterial 
      transpeptidase sortase A (SrtA(7M)) was used to ligate two PEG-peptide macromers 
      (i.e., PEG-YLPRTG and NH(2)-GGGG-PEG) into a primary hydrogel network. The hydrogels 
      were dynamically stiffened using mushroom tyrosinase (MT), which oxidized tyrosine 
      residues into di-tyrosine and led to increased matrix stiffness. After confirming 
      the expression and enhanced catalytic activity of SrtA(7M), we investigated the 
      cytocompatibility of the enzymatic reaction with a mouse insulinoma cell line, MIN6. 
      In addition, we altered peptide substrate concentrations and evaluated their 
      influence on primary hydrogel network properties and MT-triggered stiffening. Using 
      a pancreatic cancer cell line, COLO-357, the effect of MT-triggered stiffening on 
      spheroid formation was investigated. We found that cell spheroids formed in 
      hydrogels that were exposed to MT were significantly smaller than spheroids formed 
      without MT incubation, suggesting that matrix stiffening played a crucial role in 
      the sizes of cancer cell spheroids. Through utilizing highly specific and orthogonal 
      enzymatic reactions, this hydrogel platform permits rapid and mild in situ cell 
      encapsulation, as well as dynamic control of matrix stiffness for investigating the 
      role of matrix stiffening on cell fate processes.

TI  - Disorder-to-order transition of an intrinsically disordered region of sortase 
      revealed by multiscale enhanced sampling.
PG  - 7094-101
LID - 10.1021/ja3008402 [doi]
AB  - Molecular functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically 
      disordered regions (IDRs), such as molecular recognition and cellular signaling, are 
      ascribed to dynamic changes in the conformational space in response to binding of 
      target molecules. Sortase, a transpeptitase in Gram-positive bacteria, has an IDR in 
      a loop which undergoes a disordered-to-ordered transition (called "disordered 
      loop"), accompanying a tilt of another loop ("dynamic loop"), upon binding of a 
      signal peptide and a calcium ion. In this study, all-atom conformational ensembles 
      of sortase were calculated for the four different binding states (with/without the 
      peptide and with/without a calcium ion) by the multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) 
      simulation to examine how the binding of the peptide and/or calcium influences the 
      conformational ensemble. The MSES is a multiscale and multicopy simulation method 
      that allows an enhanced sampling of the all-atom model of large proteins including 
      explicit solvent. A 100 ns MSES simulation of the ligand-free sortase using 20 
      replicas (in total 2 μs) demonstrated large flexibility in both the disordered and 
      dynamic loops; however, their distributions were not random but had a clear 
      preference which populates the N-terminal part of the disordered loop near the bound 
      form. The MSES simulations of the three binding states clarified the allosteric 
      mechanism of sortase: the N- and C-terminal parts of the disordered loop undergo a 
      disorder-to-order transition independently of each other upon binding of the peptide 
      and a calcium ion, respectively; however, upon binding of both ligands, the two 
      parts work cooperatively to stabilize the bound peptide.

TI  - Staphylococcal Protein Secretion and Envelope Assembly.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.GPP3-0070-2019 [doi]
AB  - The highly cross-linked peptidoglycan represents the rigid layer of the bacterial 
      envelope and protects bacteria from osmotic lysis. In Gram-positive bacteria, 
      peptidoglycan also functions as a scaffold for the immobilization of capsular 
      polysaccharide, wall teichoic acid (WTA), and surface proteins. This chapter 
      captures recent development on the assembly of the envelope of Staphylococcus aureus 
      including mechanisms accounting for immobilization of molecules to peptidoglycan as 
      well as hydrolysis of peptidoglycan for the specific release of bound molecules, 
      facilitation of protein secretion across the envelope and cell division. 
      Peptidoglycan, WTA and capsular polysaccharide are directly synthesized onto 
      undecaprenol. Surface proteins are anchored by Sortase A, a membrane-embedded 
      transpeptidase that scans secreted polypeptides for the C-terminal LPXTG motif of 
      sorting signals. The resulting acyl enzyme intermediate is resolved by lipid II, the 
      undecaprenol-bound peptidoglycan precursor. While these pathways share membrane 
      diffusible undecaprenol, assembly of these molecules occurs either at the 
      cross-walls or the cell poles. In S. aureus, the cross-wall represents the site of 
      de novo peptidoglycan synthesis which is eventually split to complete the cell cycle 
      yielding newly divided daughter cells. Peptidoglycan synthesized at the cross-wall 
      is initially devoid of WTA. Conversely, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) synthesis which does 
      not require bactoprenol is seemingly restricted to septal membranes. Similarly, S. 
      aureus distinguishes two types of surface protein precursors. Polypeptides with 
      canonical signal peptides are deposited at the cell poles, whereas precursors with 
      conserved YSIRK-GXXS motif signal peptides traffic to the cross-wall. A model for 
      protein trafficking in the envelope and uneven distribution of teichoic acids is 
      discussed.

LID - 10.1039/c8cs00537k [doi]
AB  - Protein-based conjugates are valuable constructs for a variety of applications. 
      Conjugation of proteins to fluorophores is commonly used to study their cellular 
      localization and the protein-protein interactions. Modification of therapeutic 
      proteins with either polymers or cytotoxic moieties greatly enhances their 
      pharmacokinetics or potency. To label a protein of interest, conventional direct 
      chemical reaction with the side-chains of native amino acids often yields 
      heterogeneously modified products. This renders their characterization complicated, 
      requires difficult separation steps and may impact protein function. Although 
      modification can also be achieved via the insertion of unnatural amino acids bearing 
      bioorthogonal functional groups, these methods can have lower protein expression 
      yields, limiting large scale production. As a site-specific modification method, 
      enzymatic protein labelling is highly efficient and robust under mild reaction 
      conditions. Significant progress has been made over the last five years in modifying 
      proteins using enzymatic methods for numerous applications, including the creation 
      of clinically relevant conjugates with polymers, cytotoxins or imaging agents, 
      fluorescent or affinity probes to study complex protein interaction networks, and 
      protein-linked materials for biosensing. This review summarizes developments in 
      enzymatic protein labelling over the last five years for a panel of ten enzymes, 
      including sortase A, subtiligase, microbial transglutaminase, farnesyltransferase, 
      N-myristoyltransferase, phosphopantetheinyl transferases, tubulin tyrosin ligase, 
      lipoic acid ligase, biotin ligase and formylglycine generating enzyme.

TI  - SaccuFlow: A High-Throughput Analysis Platform to Investigate Bacterial Cell Wall 
      Interactions.
PG  - 2483-2491
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00255 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial cell walls are formidable barriers that protect bacterial cells against 
      external insults and oppose internal turgor pressure. While cell wall composition is 
      variable across species, peptidoglycan is the principal component of all cell walls. 
      Peptidoglycan is a mesh-like scaffold composed of cross-linked strands that can be 
      heavily decorated with anchored proteins. The biosynthesis and remodeling of 
      peptidoglycan must be tightly regulated by cells because disruption to this 
      biomacromolecule is lethal. This essentiality is exploited by the human innate 
      immune system in resisting colonization and by a number of clinically relevant 
      antibiotics that target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Evaluation of molecules or 
      proteins that interact with peptidoglycan can be a complicated and, typically, 
      qualitative effort. We have developed a novel assay platform (SaccuFlow) that 
      preserves the native structure of bacterial peptidoglycan and is compatible with 
      high-throughput flow cytometry analysis. We show that the assay is facile and 
      versatile as demonstrated by its compatibility with sacculi from Gram-positive 
      bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and mycobacteria. Finally, we highlight the 
      utility of this assay to assess the activity of sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus 
      against potential antivirulence agents.

AB  - Bacteria forming biofilms on surgical implants is a problem that might be alleviated 
      by the use of antibacterial coatings. In this article, recombinant spider silk was 
      functionalized with the peptidoglycan degrading endolysin SAL-1 from the 
      staphylococcal bacteriophage SAP-1 and the biofilm-matrix-degrading enzyme Dispersin 
      B from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using direct genetic fusion and/or 
      covalent protein-protein fusion catalyzed by Sortase A. Spider silk assembly and 
      enzyme immobilization was monitored using quartz crystal microbalance analysis. 
      Enzyme activity was investigated both with a biochemical assay using cleavage of 
      fluorescent substrate analogues and bacterial assays for biofilm degradation and 
      turbidity reduction. Spider silk coatings functionalized with SAL-1 and Disperin B 
      were found to exhibit bacteriolytic effect and inhibit biofilm formation, 
      respectively. The strategy to immobilize antibacterial enzymes to spider silk 
      presented herein show potential to be used as surface coatings of surgical implants 
      and other medical equipment to avoid bacterial colonization.

AB  - Cell-cell interactions and communications play fundamental roles in life processes 
      but remain largely uncharacterized. We developed an enzyme-mediated proximity cell 
      labeling (EXCELL) strategy as a general method to detect and record cell-cell 
      interactions under living conditions. EXCELL relies on an evolved Staphylococcus 
      aureus transpeptidase sortase A variant (mgSrtA) capable of promiscuous labeling of 
      various cell surface proteins containing a monoglycine residue at the N-terminus. 
      Displaying mgSrtA on the surface of a cell of interest allows the labeling and 
      detection of interacting cells in a proximity-dependent fashion.

TI  - Identification of Streptococcus suis genes preferentially expressed under iron 
      starvation by selective capture of transcribed sequences.
PG  - 123-33

AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a zoonotic Gram-positive bacterium responsible for 
      arthritis, meningitis, pneumonia and septicemia in swine and humans. Little 
      information about the regulation of iron on its gene expression had been reported. 
      In this study, 63 S. suis genes upregulated under an iron-restricted condition were 
      identified using selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCUTS) technique: 23 
      genes involved in metabolism, 22 genes responsible for the replication and genetic 
      information proceeding of the bacteria, eight genes relative to the construction of 
      the cell wall, five ATP-binding cassette transporters, four transcriptional 
      regulators and one uncharacterized gene conserved among streptococcal species. To 
      adapt to the stress, S. suis modulated its physiological activities, which were 
      validated by the upregulation of RelA (a crucial enzyme in stringent response), ArcA 
      (a component of the arginine deiminase system catalyzing the conversion of arginine 
      to ornithine) and CpdB (a cell surface protein that is a substrate of sortase A). 
      All of them were reported to be virulence factors in S. suis or other bacteria. 
      Besides, together with the results of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, we 
      found that several homologous genes (fur, fhuGBDA operons) associated with iron 
      uptake as reported in other bacteria were also upregulated under an iron-restricted 
      condition in S. suis.

TI  - A potential new pathway for Staphylococcus aureus dissemination: the silent survival 
      of S. aureus phagocytosed by human monocyte-derived macrophages.
PG  - e1409
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0001409 [doi]
LID - e1409
AB  - Although considered to be an extracellular pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus is able 
      to invade a variety of mammalian, non-professional phagocytes and can also survive 
      engulfment by professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes. In both of 
      these cell types S. aureus promptly escapes from the endosomes/phagosomes and 
      proliferates within the cytoplasm, which quickly leads to host cell death. In this 
      report we show that S. aureus interacted with human monocyte-derived macrophages in 
      a very different way to those of other mammalian cells. Upon phagocytosis by 
      macrophages, S. aureus persisted intracellularly in vacuoles for 3-4 days before 
      escaping into the cytoplasm and causing host cell lysis. Until the point of host 
      cell lysis the infected macrophages showed no signs of apoptosis or necrosis and 
      were functional. They were able to eliminate intracellular staphylococci if 
      prestimulated with interferon-gamma at concentrations equivalent to human 
      therapeutic doses. S. aureus survival was dependent on the alternative sigma factor 
      B as well as the global regulator agr, but not SarA. Furthermore, isogenic mutants 
      deficient in alpha-toxin, the metalloprotease aureolysin, protein A, and sortase A 
      were efficiently killed by macrophages upon phagocytosis, although with different 
      kinetics. In particular alpha-toxin was a key effector molecule that was essential 
      for S. aureus intracellular survival in macrophages. Together, our data indicate 
      that the ability of S. aureus to survive phagocytosis by macrophages is determined 
      by multiple virulence factors in a way that differs considerably from its 
      interactions with other cell types. S. aureus persists inside macrophages for 
      several days without affecting the viability of these mobile cells which may serve 
      as vehicles for the dissemination of infection.

TI  - Pilus biogenesis in Lactococcus lactis: molecular characterization and role in 
      aggregation and biofilm formation.
PG  - e50989
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0050989 [doi]
LID - e50989
AB  - The genome of Lactococcus lactis strain IL1403 harbors a putative pilus biogenesis 
      cluster consisting of a sortase C gene flanked by 3 LPxTG protein encoding genes 
      (yhgD, yhgE, and yhhB), called here pil. However, pili were not detected under 
      standard growth conditions. Over-expression of the pil operon resulted in production 
      and display of pili on the surface of lactococci. Functional analysis of the pilus 
      biogenesis machinery indicated that the pilus shaft is formed by oligomers of the 
      YhgE pilin, that the pilus cap is formed by the YhgD pilin and that YhhB is the 
      basal pilin allowing the tethering of the pilus fibers to the cell wall. 
      Oligomerization of pilin subunits was catalyzed by sortase C while anchoring of pili 
      to the cell wall was mediated by sortase A. Piliated L. lactis cells exhibited an 
      auto-aggregation phenotype in liquid cultures, which was attributed to the 
      polymerization of major pilin, YhgE. The piliated lactococci formed thicker, more 
      aerial biofilms compared to those produced by non-piliated bacteria. This phenotype 
      was attributed to oligomers of YhgE. This study provides the first dissection of the 
      pilus biogenesis machinery in a non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium. Analysis of 
      natural lactococci isolates from clinical and vegetal environments showed pili 
      production under standard growth conditions. The identification of functional pili 
      in lactococci suggests that the changes they promote in aggregation and biofilm 
      formation may be important for the natural lifestyle as well as for applications in 
      which these bacteria are used.

      Ras with its cysteine-rich domain (CRD). However, the molecular basis for this 
      interaction remains unclear because of difficulties in preparing modified Ras in 
      amounts sufficient for structural studies. Here, we use Sortase A-catalyzed protein 
      ligation to prepare modified Ras in sufficient amounts for NMR and X-ray 
      crystallographic analyses. The results show that the farnesylated C terminus 
      establishes an intramolecular interaction with the catalytic domain and brings the 
      farnesyl moiety to the proximity of the activator region, which may be responsible 
      for their cooperative recognition of c-Raf-1-CRD.

PG  - 48-66
AB  - Sortases are a family of transpeptidases found in Gram-positive bacteria responsible 
      for covalent anchoring of cell surface proteins to bacterial cell walls. It has been 
      discovered that sortase A (SrtA) of Staphylococcus aureus origin is rather 
      promiscuous and can accept various molecules as substrates. As a result, SrtA has 
      been widely used to ligate peptides and proteins with a variety of nucleophiles, and 
      the ligation products are useful for research in chemical biology, proteomics, 
      biomedicine, etc. This review summarizes the recent applications of SrtA with 
      special emphasis on SrtA-catalyzed ligation of carbohydrates with peptides and 
      proteins.

TI  - Simple sequence repeats and genome plasticity in Streptococcus agalactiae.
PG  - 3990-4000
LID - 10.1128/JB.01465-09 [doi]
AB  - Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and their role in phase variation have been 
      extensively studied in Gram-negative organisms, where they have been associated with 
      antigenic variation and other adaptation strategies. In this study, we apply 
      comparative genomics in order to find evidence of slipped-strand mispairing in the 
      human Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae. In two consecutive 
      screenings, 2,233 (650 + 1,583) SSRs were identified in our reference genome 
      2603V/R, and these loci were examined in seven other S. agalactiae genomes. A total 
      of 56 SSR loci were found to exhibit variation, where gain or loss of repeat units 
      was observed in at least one other genome, resulting in aberrant genotypes. 
      Homopolymeric adenine tracts predominated among the repeats that varied. Positional 
      analysis revealed that long polyadenine tracts were overrepresented in the 5' ends 
      of open reading frames (ORFs) and underrepresented in the 3' ends. Repeat clustering 
      in ORFs was also examined, and the highest degree of clustering was observed for a 
      capsule biosynthesis gene and a pilus sortase. A statistical analysis of observed 
      over expected ratios suggested a selective pressure against long homopolymeric 
      tracts. Altered phenotypes were verified for three genes encoding surface-attached 
      proteins, in which frameshifts or fusions led to truncation of proteins and/or 
      affected surface localization through loss or gain of the cell wall sorting signal. 
      The data suggest that SSRs contributes to genome plasticity in S. agalactiae but 
      that the bet-hedging strategy is different from Gram-negative organisms.

TI  - Streptococcus mutans extracellular DNA is upregulated during growth in biofilms, 
      actively released via membrane vesicles, and influenced by components of the protein 
      secretion machinery.
PG  - 2355-66
LID - 10.1128/JB.01493-14 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, a major etiological agent of human dental caries, lives 
      primarily on the tooth surface in biofilms. Limited information is available 
      concerning the extracellular DNA (eDNA) as a scaffolding matrix in S. mutans 
      biofilms. This study demonstrates that S. mutans produces eDNA by multiple avenues, 
      including lysis-independent membrane vesicles. Unlike eDNAs from cell lysis that 
      were abundant and mainly concentrated around broken cells or cell debris with 
      floating open ends, eDNAs produced via the lysis-independent pathway appeared 
      scattered but in a structured network under scanning electron microscopy. Compared 
      to eDNA production of planktonic cultures, eDNA production in 5- and 24-h biofilms 
      was increased by >3- and >1.6-fold, respectively. The addition of DNase I to growth 
      medium significantly reduced biofilm formation. In an in vitro adherence assay, 
      added chromosomal DNA alone had a limited effect on S. mutans adherence to 
      saliva-coated hydroxylapatite beads, but in conjunction with glucans synthesized 
      using purified glucosyltransferase B, the adherence was significantly enhanced. 
      Deletion of sortase A, the transpeptidase that covalently couples multiple 
      surface-associated proteins to the cell wall peptidoglycan, significantly reduced 
      eDNA in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. Sortase A deficiency did not have a 
      significant effect on membrane vesicle production; however, the protein profile of 
      the mutant membrane vesicles was significantly altered, including reduction of 
      adhesin P1 and glucan-binding proteins B and C. Relative to the wild type, 
      deficiency of protein secretion and membrane protein insertion machinery components, 
      including Ffh, YidC1, and YidC2, also caused significant reductions in eDNA.

      Bacteria.
PG  - 2039-2044
LID - 10.1002/cbic.201800295 [doi]
AB  - To combat antimicrobial infections, new active molecules are needed. Antimicrobial 
      peptides, ever abundant in nature, are a fertile starting point to develop new 
      antimicrobial agents but suffer from low stability, low specificity, and off-target 
      toxicity. These drawbacks have limited their development. To overcome some of these 
      limitations, we developed antibody-bactericidal macrocyclic peptide conjugates 
      (ABCs), in which the antibody directs the bioactive macrocyclic peptide to the 
      targeted Gram-negative bacteria. We used cysteine S(N) Ar chemistry to synthesize 
      and systematically study a library of large (>30-mer) macrocyclic antimicrobial 
      peptides (mAMPs) to discover variants with extended proteolytic stability in human 
      serum and low hemolytic activity while maintaining bioactivity. We then conjugated, 
      by using sortase A, these bioactive variants onto an Escherichia coli targeted 
      monoclonal antibody. We found that these ABCs had minimized hemolytic activity and 
      were able to kill E. coli at nanomolar concentrations. Our findings suggest 
      macrocyclic peptides if fused to antibodies may facilitate the discovery of new 
      agents to treat bacterial infections.

PG  - 21003-21015
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus or GBS) is a common cause of 
      invasive infections in newborn infants and adults. The ability of GBS to bind human 
      fibrinogen is of crucial importance in promoting colonization and invasion of host 
      barriers. We characterized here a novel fibrinogen-binding protein of GBS, 
      designated FbsC (Gbs0791), which is encoded by the prototype GBS strain NEM316. 
      FbsC, which bears two bacterial immunoglobulin-like tandem repeat domains and a 
      C-terminal cell wall-anchoring motif (LPXTG), was found to be covalently linked to 
      the cell wall by the housekeeping sortase A. Studies using recombinant FbsC 
      indicated that it binds fibrinogen in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, and 
      with moderate affinity. Expression of FbsC was detected in all clinical GBS 
      isolates, except those belonging to the hypervirulent lineage ST17. Deletion of fbsC 
      decreases NEM316 abilities to adhere to and invade human epithelial and endothelial 
      cells, and to form biofilm in vitro. Notably, bacterial adhesion to fibrinogen and 
      fibrinogen binding to bacterial cells were abolished following fbsC deletion in 
      NEM316. Moreover, the virulence of the fbsC deletion mutant and its ability to 
      colonize the brain were impaired in murine models of infection. Finally, 
      immunization with recombinant FbsC significantly protected mice from lethal GBS 
      challenge. In conclusion, FbsC is a novel fibrinogen-binding protein expressed by 
      most GBS isolates that functions as a virulence factor by promoting invasion of 
      epithelial and endothelial barriers. In addition, the protein has significant 
      immunoprotective activity and may be a useful component of an anti-GBS vaccine.

TI  - Regulated cleavage of glycan strands by the murein hydrolase SagB in S. aureus 
      involves a direct interaction with LyrA (SpdC).
LID - JB.00014-21 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00014-21 [doi]
LID - e00014-21
AB  - LyrA (SpdC), a homologue of eukaryotic CAAX proteases that act on prenylated 
      substrates, has been implicated in the assembly of several pathways of the envelope 
      of Staphylococcus aureus. We described earlier the Lysostaphin resistance (Lyr) and 
      Staphylococcal protein A display (Spd) phenotypes associated with loss of the lyrA 
      (spdC) gene. However, a direct contribution to the assembly of pentaglycine 
      crossbridges, the target of lysostaphin cleavage in S. aureus peptidoglycan, or of 
      Staphylococcal protein A attachment to peptidoglycan could not be attributed 
      directly to LyrA (SpdC). These two processes are catalyzed by the Fem factors and 
      Sortase A, respectively. To gain insight into the function of LyrA (SpdC), here we 
      use affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS analysis and report that LyrA interacts 
      with SagB. SagB cleaves glycan strands of peptidoglycan to achieve physiological 
      length. Similar to sagB peptidoglycan, lyrA peptidoglycan contains extended glycan 
      strands. Purified lyrA peptidoglycan can still be cleaved to physiological length by 
      SagB in vitro LyrA does not modify or cleave peptidoglycan, it also does not modify 
      or stabilize SagB. The membrane bound domain of LyrA is sufficient to support SagB 
      activity but predicted 'CAAX enzyme' catalytic residues in this domain are 
      dispensable. We speculate that LyrA exerts its effect on bacterial prenyl 
      substrates, specifically undecaprenol-bound peptidoglycan substrates of SagB, to 
      help control glycan length. Such an activity also explains the Lyr and Spd 
      phenotypes observed earlier.IMPORTANCE Peptidoglycan is assembled on the trans side 
      of the plasma membrane from lipid II precursors into glycan chains that are 
      crosslinked at stem peptides. In S. aureus, SagB, a membrane-associated 
      N-acetylglucosaminidase, cleaves polymerized glycan chains to their physiological 
      length. Deletion of sagB is associated with longer glycan strands in peptidoglycan, 
      altered protein trafficking and secretion in the envelope, and aberrant excretion of 
      cytosolic proteins. It is not clear whether SagB, with its single transmembrane 
      segment, serves as the molecular ruler of glycan chains or whether other factors 
      modulate its activity. Here, we show that LyrA (SpdC), a protein of the CAAX type II 
      prenyl endopeptidase family, modulates SagB activity via interaction though its 
      transmembrane domain.

TI  - Force-activated catalytic pathway accelerates bacterial adhesion against flow.
PG  - 2611-2620
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20180358 [doi]
AB  - Mechanical cues often influence the factors affecting the transition states of 
      catalytic reactions and alter the activation pathway. However, tracking the 
      real-time dynamics of such activation pathways is limited. Using single-molecule 
      trapping of reaction intermediates, we developed a method that enabled us to perform 
      one reaction at one site and simultaneously study the real-time dynamics of the 
      catalytic pathway. Using this, we showed single-molecule calligraphy at nanometer 
      resolution and deciphered the mechanism of the sortase A enzymatic reaction that, 
      counter-intuitively, accelerates bacterial adhesion under shear tension. Our method 
      captured a force-induced dissociation of the enzyme-substrate bond that accelerates 
      the forward reaction 100×, proposing a new mechano-activated catalytic pathway. In 
      corroboration, our molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of force 
      identified a force-induced conformational switch in the enzyme that accelerates 
      proton transfer between CYS184 (acceptor) and HIS120 (donor) catalytic dyads by 
      reducing the inter-residue distances. Overall, the present study opens up the 
      possibility of studying the influence of factors affecting transition states in real 
      time and paves the way for the rational design of enzymes with enhanced efficiency.

TI  - Identification of target-binding peptide motifs by high-throughput sequencing of 
      phage-selected peptides.
PG  - e169
LID - 10.1093/nar/gku940 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput sequencing was previously applied to phage-selected peptides in 
      order to gain insight into the abundance and diversity of isolated peptides. Herein 
      we developed a procedure to efficiently compare the sequences of large numbers of 
      phage-selected peptides for the purpose of identifying target-binding peptide 
      motifs. We applied the procedure to analyze bicyclic peptides isolated against five 
      different protein targets: sortase A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, 
      coagulation factor XII, plasma kallikrein and streptavidin. We optimized sequence 
      data filters to reduce biases originating from the sequencing method and developed 
      sequence correction algorithms to prevent identification of false consensus motifs. 
      With our strategy, we were able to identify rare target-binding peptide motifs, as 
      well as to define more precisely consensus sequences and sub-groups of consensus 
      sequences. This information is valuable to choose peptide leads for drug development 
      and it facilitates identification of epitopes. We furthermore show that binding 
      motifs can be identified after a single round of phage selection. Such a selection 
      regimen reduces propagation-related bias and may facilitate application of phage 
      display in non-specialized laboratories, as procedures such as bacterial infection, 
      phage propagation and purification are not required.

TI  - Development of a general bioluminescent activity assay for peptide ligases.
LID - 10.1111/febs.16416 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, some peptide ligases have been identified, such as bacterial 
      sortases and certain plant asparaginyl or prolyl endopeptidases. Peptide ligases 
      have wide applications in protein labelling and cyclic peptide synthesis. To 
      characterize various known peptide ligases or identify new ones, we propose a 
      general bioluminescent activity assay via the genetic fusion of a recognition motif 
      of peptide ligase(s) to the C-terminus of an inactive large NanoLuc fragment (LgBiT) 
      and the chemical introduction of a nucleophilic motif preferred by the peptide 
      ligase(s) to the N-terminus of the low-affinity SmBiT complementation tag. After the 
      inactive ligation version LgBiT protein was ligated with the low-affinity ligation 
      version SmBiT tag by the expected peptide ligase(s), its luciferase activity would 
      be restored and could be quantified sensitively according to the measured 
      bioluminescence. In the present study, we first validated the bioluminescent 
      activity assay using bacterial sortase A and plant-derived butelase-1. Subsequently, 
      we screened novel peptide ligases from crude extracts of selected plants using two 
      LgBiT-SmBiT ligation pairs. Among 80 common higher plants, we identified that five 
      of them likely express asparaginyl endopeptidase-type peptide ligase and four of 
      them likely express prolyl endopeptidase-type peptide ligase, suggesting that 
      peptide ligases are not so rare in higher plants and more of them await discovery. 
      The present bioluminescent activity assay is ultrasensitive, convenient for use, and 
      resistant to protease interference, and thus would have wide applications for 
      characterizing known peptide ligases or screening new ones from various sources in 
      future studies.

AB  - Polysaccharides and proteins are important macromolecules for developing hydrogels 
      devoted to biomedical applications. Chemical hydrogels offer chemical, mechanical, 
      and dimensional stability than physical hydrogels due to the chemical bonds among 
      the chains mediated by crosslinkers. There are many crosslinkers to synthesize 
      polysaccharides and proteins based on hydrogels. In this review, we revisited the 
      crosslinking reaction mechanisms between synthetic or natural crosslinkers and 
      polysaccharides or proteins. The selected synthetic crosslinkers were 
      glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide, boric acid, sodium trimetaphosphate, N,N'-methylene 
      bisacrylamide, and polycarboxylic acid, whereas the selected natural crosslinkers 
      included transglutaminase, tyrosinase, horseradish peroxidase, laccase, sortase A, 
      genipin, vanillin, tannic acid, and phytic acid. No less important are the reactions 
      involving click chemistry and the macromolecular crosslinkers for polysaccharides 
      and proteins. Literature examples of polysaccharides or proteins crosslinked by the 
      different strategies were presented along with the corresponding highlights. The 
      general mechanism involved in chemical crosslinking mediated by gamma and UV 
      radiation was discussed, with particular attention to materials commonly used in 
      digital light processing. The evaluation of crosslinking efficiency by gravimetric 
      measurements, rheology, and spectroscopic techniques was presented. Finally, we

AB  - Natural berberine-hybridized benzimidazoles as potential antibacterial agents were 
      constructed to treat Staphylococcus aureus infection in the livestock industry. 
      Bioassay showed that some new berberine-benzimidazole hybrids exhibited potent 
      antibacterial efficacies, especially, the 2,4-dichlorobenzyl derivative 7d not only 
      showed strong activity against S. aureus ATCC 29213 with the MIC value of 0.006 mM 
      but also effectively eradicated bacterial biofilm and exhibited low toxicity toward 
      mammalian cells. The drug combination experiments showed that compound 7d together 
      with norfloxacin could enhance the antibacterial efficacy. Moreover, the 
      2,4-dichlorobenzyl derivative 7d did not show obvious propensity to develop 
      bacterial resistance. Preliminary mechanism studies revealed that the active 
      molecule 7d could damage the membrane integrity, stimulate ROS generation, and bind 
      with DNA as well as S. aureus sortase A, thus exerting powerful antibacterial 
      ability. In light of these facts, berberine-benzimidazole hybrid 7d showed a large 
      potentiality as a new bactericide for treating S. aureus in the livestock industry.

TI  - Single-step affinity purification of recombinant proteins using a self-excising 
      module from Neisseria meningitidis FrpC.
PG  - 1834-43
LID - 10.1110/ps.035733.108 [doi]
AB  - Purification of recombinant proteins is often a challenging process involving 
      several chromatographic steps that must be optimized for each target protein. Here, 
      we developed a self-excising module allowing single-step affinity chromatography 
      purification of untagged recombinant proteins. It consists of a 250-residue-long 
      self-processing module of the Neisseria meningitidis FrpC protein with a C-terminal 
      affinity tag. The N terminus of the module is fused to the C terminus of a target 
      protein of interest. Upon binding of the fusion protein to an affinity matrix from 
      cell lysate and washing out contaminating proteins, site-specific cleavage of the 
      Asp-Pro bond linking the target protein to the self-excising module is induced by 
      calcium ions. This results in the release of the target protein with only a single 
      aspartic acid residue added at the C terminus, while the self-excising affinity 
      module remains trapped on the affinity matrix. The system was successfully tested 
      with several target proteins, including glutathione-S-transferase, maltose-binding 
      protein, beta-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and adenylate 
      cyclase, and two different affinity tags, chitin-binding domain or poly-His. 
      Moreover, it was demonstrated that it can be applied as an alternative to two 
      currently existing systems, based on the self-splicing intein of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae and sortase A of Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Site-Specific Glycation and Chemo-enzymatic Antibody Sortagging for the Retargeting 
      of rAAV6 to Inflamed Endothelium.
PG  - 261-269
LID - 10.1016/j.omtm.2019.07.003 [doi]
AB  - Gene therapy holds great potential for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, 
      including atherosclerosis and also vascular cancers, yet available vectors such as 
      the adeno-associated virus (rAAV) transduce the vasculature poorly. To enable 
      retargeting, a single-chain antibody (scFv) that binds to the vascular cell-adhesion 
      molecule (VCAM-1) overexpressed at areas of endothelial inflammation was site 
      specifically and covalently conjugated to the exterior of rAAV6. To achieve 
      conjugation, the scFv was functionalized with an orthogonal click chemistry group. 
      This conjugation utilized site-specific sortase A methodology, thus preserving scFv 
      binding capacity to VCAM-1. The AAV6 was separately functionalized with 
      4-azidophenyl glyoxal (APGO) via covalent adducts to arginine residues in the 
      capsid's heparin co-receptor binding region. APGO functionalization removed native 
      tropism, greatly reducing rAAV6-GFP transduction into all cells tested, and the 
      effect was similar to the inhibition seen in the presence of heparin. Utilizing the 
      incorporated functionalizations, the scFv was then covalently conjugated to the 
      exterior of rAAV6 via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). With both 
      the removal of native heparin tropism and the addition of VCAM-1 targeting, rAAV6 
      transduction of endothelial cells was greatly enhanced compared to control cells. 
      Thus, this novel and modular targeting system could have further application in 
      re-directing AAV6 toward inflamed endothelium for therapeutic use.

AB  - Sortases are enzymes mostly found in Gram-positive bacteria which cleave proteins 
      site-specifically. This feature makes them a promising tool in molecular biology and 
      biotechnology. In this study, using bacterial surface display of recombinant 
      proteins and ability of sortase A in site-specifically cleavage of the amino acid 
      sequences, a novel method for one-step purification of recombinant proteins was 
      developed. Using computational program tools, a chimeric protein containing a 
      metallothionein (mt) and chitin binding domain (ChBD) was attached to the C-terminal 
      domain of the truncated outer membrane protein A (Lpp'-ompA) using sortase 
      recognition site (amino acid residues: LPQTG) as a separator. The structure of the 
      chimeric protein was simulated using molecular dynamics to determine if the LPQTG 
      motif is accessible to the sortase active site. The designed chimeric protein was 
      expressed and purified. The purified chimeric protein was also displayed on the 
      surface of E. coli cells. Both purified chimeric protein and the E. coli cells 
      displaying Lpp'-ompA-mt-ChBD carrier protein were then treated with sortase to 
      evaluate the efficiency of sortase-mediated cleavage of purified chimeric protein as 
      well as surface displayed-chimeric protein. It is shown that mt-ChBD protein was 
      successfully cleaved and dissociated from Lpp'-ompA carrier and released into the 
      medium after treatment with sortase in both recombinant protein and surface 
      displayed-chimeric protein. The experimental results confirmed the molecular 
      dynamics analysis results. The presented method could be regarded as a novel 
      strategy for one step expression and purification of recombinant proteins.

TI  - Self-Assembled Hybrid Aptamer-Fc Conjugates for Targeted Delivery: A Modular 
      Chemoenzymatic Approach.
PG  - 2158-65
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.5b00315 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, DNA and RNA aptamers have attracted keen research interest due 
      to their ability to specifically bind targets of therapeutic relevance. However, 
      their application is often hampered by a short serum half-life and missing effector 
      functions. Conjugation of aptamers to antibody Fc fragments could improve 
      pharmacokinetics, enable immune effector mechanisms, and provide an option for the 
      introduction of desired payloads (e.g., toxins or fluorescent dyes). We developed a 
      modular scaffold-supported system based on human IgG1 Fc fragments, which allows for 
      its dual functionalization with moieties of interest. In our approach, two 
      bioorthogonal, enzyme-mediated reactions were used in combination with oxime 
      ligation and self-assembly based on PNA-DNA base pairing. Thus, an engineered 
      synthetic peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomer was coupled to the C-termini of the Fc 
      dimer upon sequence-specific sortase A-mediated transpeptidation. Hybridization of 
      the resulting Fc-PNA conjugate with a tailored DNA aptamer that binds cancer-related 
      hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET) led to a hybrid construct which showed 
      strong and specific binding to c-MET and was readily internalized by 
      c-MET-overexpressing cells. To install an additional orthogonally addressable site, 
      aldehyde tag technology was applied followed by oxime ligation with an 
      aminooxy-bearing fluorescent dye as model cargo. Delivery of fluorescent probe 
      specifically to c-MET-overexpressing cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. Our 
      approach can provide access to engineered aptamer-Fc conjugates with desired target 
      specificity and cytotoxic payloads.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel 38.5-kilodalton cell surface protein 
      of Staphylococcus aureus with extended-spectrum binding activity for extracellular 
      matrix and plasma proteins.
PG  - 6778-86
AB  - The ability to attach to host ligands is a well-established pathogenic factor in 
      invasive Staphylococcus aureus disease. In addition to the family of adhesive 
      proteins bound to the cell wall via the sortase A (srtA) mechanism, secreted 
      proteins such as the fibrinogen-binding protein Efb, the extracellular adhesion 
      protein Eap, or coagulase have been found to interact with various extracellular 
      host molecules. Here we describe a novel protein, the extracellular matrix 
      protein-binding protein (Emp) initially identified in Western ligand blots as a 
      40-kDa protein due to its broad-spectrum recognition of fibronectin, fibrinogen, 
      collagen, and vitronectin. Emp is expressed in the stationary growth phase and is 
      closely associated with the cell surface and yet is extractable by sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate. The conferring gene emp (1,023 nucleotides) encodes a signal peptide of 26 
      amino acids and a mature protein of a calculated molecular mass of 35.5 kDa. Using 
      PCR, emp was demonstrated in all 240 S. aureus isolates of a defined clinical strain 
      collection as well as in 6 S. aureus laboratory strains, whereas it is lacking in 
      all 10 S. epidermidis strains tested. Construction of an allelic replacement mutant 
      (mEmp50) revealed the absence of Emp in mEmp50, a significantly decreased adhesion 
      of mEmp50 to immobilized fibronectin and fibrinogen, and restoration of these 
      characteristics upon complementation of mEmp50. Emp expression was also demonstrable 
      upon heterologous complementation of S. carnosus. rEmp expressed in Escherichia coli 
      interacted with fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin in surface plasmon 
      resonance experiments at a K(d) of 21 nM, 91 nM, and 122 pM, respectively. In 
      conclusion, the biologic characterization of Emp suggests that it is a member of the 
      group of secreted S. aureus molecules that interact with an extended spectrum of 
      host ligands and thereby contribute to S. aureus pathogenicity.

TI  - Effectiveness of Bioactive Compound as Antibacterial and Anti-Quorum Sensing Agent 
      from Myrmecodia pendans: An In Silico Study.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26092465 [doi]
LID - 2465
AB  - BACKGROUND: antibiotic resistance encourages the development of new therapies, or 
      the discovery of novel antibacterial agents. Previous research revealed that 
      Myrmecodia pendans (Sarang Semut) contain potential antibacterial agents. However, 
      specific proteins inhibited by them have not yet been identified as either proteins 
      targeted by antibiotics or proteins that have a role in the quorum-sensing system. 
      This study aims to investigate and predict the action mode of antibacterial 
      compounds with specific proteins by following the molecular docking approach. 
      METHODS: butein (1), biflavonoid (2), 3″-methoxyepicatechin-3-O-epicatechin (3), 
      2-dodecyl-4-hydroxylbenzaldehyde (4), 2-dodecyl-4-hydroxylbenzaldehyde (5), pomolic 
      acid (6), betulin (7), and sitosterol-(6'-O-tridecanoil)-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (8) 
      from M. pendans act as the ligand. Antibiotics or substrates in each protein were 
      used as a positive control. To screen the bioactivity of compounds, ligands were 
      analyzed by Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) program. They were 
      docked with 12 proteins by AutoDock Vina in the PyRx 0.8 software application. Those 
      proteins are penicillin-binding protein (PBP), MurB, Sortase A (SrtA), 
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) gyrase, ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, ribosomal 
      protein, Cytolysin M (ClyM), FsrB, gelatinase binding-activating pheromone (GBAP), 
      and PgrX retrieved from UniProt. The docking results were analyzed by the 
      ProteinsPlus and Discovery Studio software applications. RESULTS: most compounds 
      have Pa value over 0.5 against proteins in the cell wall. In nearly all proteins, 
      biflavonoid (2) has the strongest binding affinity. However, compound 2 binds only 
      three residues, so that 2 is the non-competitive inhibitor. CONCLUSION: compound 2 
      can be a lead compound for an antibacterial agent in each pathway.

TI  - Palladium Oxidative Addition Complexes for Peptide and Protein Cross-linking.
PG  - 3128-3133
LID - 10.1021/jacs.8b00172 [doi]
AB  - A new method for cysteine-lysine cross-linking in peptides and proteins using 
      palladium oxidative addition complexes is presented. First, a 
      biarylphosphine-supported palladium reagent is used to transfer an aryl group 
      bearing an O-phenyl carbamate substituent to a cysteine residue. Next, this 
      carbamate undergoes chemoselective acyl substitution by a proximal lysine to form a 
      cross-link. The linkage so formed is stable toward acid, base, oxygen, and external 
      thiol nucleophiles. This method was applied to cross-link cysteine with nearby 
      lysines in sortase A*. Furthermore, we used this method for the intermolecular 
      cross-linking between a peptide and a protein based on the p53-MDM2 interaction. 
      These studies demonstrate the potential for palladium-mediated methods to serve as a 
      platform for the development of future cross-linking techniques for peptides and 
      proteins with natural amino acid residues.

TI  - Amino acid residues critical for endoplasmic reticulum export and trafficking of 
      platelet-activating factor receptor.
PG  - 5931-40
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.066282 [doi]
AB  - Several residues are conserved in the transmembrane domains (TMs) of G-protein 
      coupled receptors. Here we demonstrate that a conserved proline, Pro(247), in TM6 of 
      platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) is required for endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER) export and trafficking after agonist-induced internalization. 
      Alanine-substituted mutants of the conserved residues of PAFRs, including P247A, 
      were retained in the ER. Because a PAFR antagonist, Y-24180, acted as a 
      pharmacological chaperone to rescue ER retention, this retention is due to 
      misfolding of PAFR. Methylcarbamyl (mc)-PAF, a PAFR agonist, did not increase the 
      cell surface expression of P247A, even though another ER-retained mutant, D63A, was 
      effectively trafficked. Signaling and accumulation of the receptors in the early 
      endosomes were observed in the mc-PAF-treated P247A-expressing cells, suggesting 
      that P247A was trafficked to the cell surface by mc-PAF, and thereafter disappeared 
      from the surface due to aberrant trafficking, e.g. enhanced internalization, 
      deficiency in recycling, and/or accelerated degradation. The aberrant trafficking 
      was confirmed with a sortase-A-mediated method for labeling cell surface proteins. 
      These results demonstrate that the conserved proline in TM6 is crucial for 
      intracellular trafficking of PAFR.

TI  - Site-specific C-terminal dinitrophenylation to reconstitute the antibody Fc 
      functions for nanobodies.

LID - 10.1039/c9sc03840j [doi]
AB  - Nanobodies are a class of camelid-derived single-domain antibodies that have many 
      potential advantages over conventional antibodies and have been utilized to develop 
      new therapeutic strategies for cancer and other diseases. However, nanobodies lack 
      the Fc region of a conventional antibody, which possesses many functions, e.g., 
      eliciting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
      cytotoxicity (CDC), essential for effective immunotherapy. The small molecular size 
      of nanobodies also leads to poor pharmacokinetics, such as short in vivo half-life. 
      To address these deficiencies, an endogenous antibody-based strategy to reconstitute 
      the Fc functions for nanobodies was developed. As a proof-of-principle, an 
      anti-human EGFR nanobody, 7D12, was selected to conduct C-terminal modification with 
      the dinitrophenyl (DNP) hapten through Sortase A-mediated site-specific ligation. It 
      was expected that the DNP motif would recruit endogenous human anti-DNP antibodies 
      to indirectly reinstate the Fc functions. The resultant nanobody-DNP conjugates were 
      shown to exhibit specific and high affinity binding to human EGFR expressed on 
      target cancer cells. It was further proved that in the presence of anti-DNP 
      antibody, these conjugates could mediate potent ADCC and CDC in vitro and exhibit 
      significantly elongated half-life in vivo. Ultimately, it was proven in severe 
      combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice that treatment with the nanobody 7D12-DNP 
      conjugate and anti-DNP mouse serum could inhibit xenograft tumor growth efficiently. 
      In view of the abundance of anti-DNP and other endogenous antibodies in the human 
      blood system, this could be a generally applicable approach employed to reconstitute 
      the Fc functions for nanobodies and develop nanobody-based cancer immunotherapy and 
      other therapies.

AB  - Recombinant antibodies can be expressed as fusion constructs in combination with 
      tags which simplify their engineering into reliable and homogeneous immunoreagents 
      by allowing site-specific, 1:1 functionalization. Several tags and corresponding 
      reagents for recombinant protein derivatization have been proposed but benchmarking 
      surveys for the evaluation of their effect on the characteristics of recombinant 
      antibodies have not been reported. In this work we evaluated the impact on 
      expression yields, shelf-stability, thermostability and binding affinity of a set of 
      C-terminal tags fused to the same anti-Her2 nanobody. Furthermore, we assessed the 
      efficiency of the derivatization process. The constructs always bore a 6xHis tag 
      plus either the controls (EGFP and C-tag) or CLIP, HALO, AviTag, the LEPTG sequence 
      recognized by Sortase A (Sortase tag), or a free cysteine. The advantages and 
      drawbacks of the different systems were analyzed and discussed.

TI  - Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Whole Secretome and Amylase-precipitated Secretome 
      Proteins from Streptococcus gordonii.
PG  - 287-295
AB  - Oral biofilm (dental plaque) is formed by the initial adhesion of "pioneer species" 
      to salivary proteins that form the dental pellicle on the tooth surface. One such 
      pioneer species, Streptococcus gordonii, is known to bind salivary amylase through 
      specific amylase-binding proteins such as amylase-binding protein A (AbpA). Recent 
      studies have demonstrated that once bound, salivary amylase appears to modulate gene 
      expression in S. gordonii. However, it is not known if this amylase-induced gene 
      expression leads to secretion of proteins that play a role in plaque biofilm 
      formation. In this study we examined the differences in secreted proteomes between 
      S. gordonii KS1 (wild type) and AbpA-deficient (ΔAbpA) strains. We also examined the 
      differentially precipitated secretome proteins following incubation with salivary 
      amylase. The culture supernatants from KS1 and ΔAbpA were analyzed by nano-LC/MS/MS 
      to characterize the whole secreted proteomes of the KS1 and ΔAbpA. A total of 107 
      proteins were identified in the KS1 and ΔAbpA secretomes of which 72 proteins were 
      predicted to have an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion. Five proteins were 
      differentially expressed between the KS1 and ΔAbpA secretomes; AbpA and sortase B 
      were expressed exclusively by KS1, whereas Gdh, AdcA and GroEL were expressed only 
      by ΔAbpA. Incubation of culture supernatants from KS1 and ΔAbpA with amylase (50 
      μg/ml) at room temperature for 2 h resulted in the differential precipitation of 
      secretome proteins. Hypothetical protein (SGO_0483), cation-transporting ATPase YfgQ 
      (Aha1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (Icd), sortase A (SrtA), 
      beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (SGO_0405), peptide chain release factor 1(PrfA) and 
      cardiolipin synthase (SGO_2037) were precipitated by amylase from the KS1 culture 
      supernatant. Among the identified secreted proteins and amylase-precipitated 
      proteins, transcriptional regulator LytR (SGO_0535) and cation-transporting ATPase 
      YfgQ (Aha1) are potential signaling proteins.

TI  - Mode of expression and functional characterization of FCT-3 pilus region-encoded 
      proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M49.
PG  - 32-44
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00772-08 [doi]
AB  - The human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) pilus 
      components, suggested to play a role in pathogenesis, are encoded in the variable 
      FCT (fibronectin- and collagen-binding T-antigen) region. We investigated the 
      functions of sortase A (SrtA), sortase C2 (SrtC2), and the FctA protein of the most 
      prevalent type 3 FCT region from a serotype M49 strain. Although it is considered a 
      housekeeping sortase, SrtA's activity is involved in pilus formation in addition to 
      its essentiality for GAS extracellular matrix protein binding, host cell 
      adherence/internalization, survival in human blood, and biofilm formation. SrtC2 
      activity is crucial for pilus formation but dispensable for the other phenotypes 
      tested in vitro. FctA is the major pilus backbone protein, simultaneously acting as 
      the M49 T antigen, and requires SrtC2 and LepA, a signal peptidase I homologue, for 
      monomeric surface expression and polymerization, respectively. Collagen-binding 
      protein Cpa expression supports pilus formation at the pilus base. 
      Immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis 
      revealed several unexpected expression patterns, as follows: (i) the monomeric pilus 
      protein FctA was found exclusively at the old poles of GAS cells, (ii) FctA protein 
      expression increased with lower temperatures, and (iii) FctA protein expression was 
      restricted to 20 to 50% of a given GAS M49 population, suggesting regulation by a 
      bistability mode. Notably, disruption of pilus assembly by sortase deletion rendered 
      GAS serotype M49 significantly more aggressive in a dermonecrotic mouse infection 
      model, indicating that sortase activity and, consequently, pilus expression allow a 
      subpopulation of this GAS serotype to be less aggressive. Thus, pilus expression may 
      not be a virulence attribute of GAS per se.

TI  - A head-to-head comparison of conjugation methods for VHHs: Random maleimide-thiol 
      coupling versus controlled click chemistry.
PG  - 100020
LID - 10.1016/j.ijpx.2019.100020 [doi]
LID - 100020
AB  - Targeted delivery of therapeutics is an attractive strategy for vascular diseases. 
      Recently, variable domains of heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHHs) have gained 
      momentum as targeting ligands to achieve this. Targeting ligands need adequate 
      conjugation to the preferred delivery platform. When choosing a conjugation method, 
      two features are critical: a fixed and specified stoichiometry and an orientation of 
      the conjugated targeting ligand that preserves its functional binding capacity. We 
      here describe a comparison of popular maleimide-thiol conjugation with 
      state-of-the-art "click chemistry" for conjugating VHHs. First, we demonstrate the 
      modification of VHHs with azide via Sortase A mediated transpeptidation. 
      Subsequently, optimal clicking conditions were found at a temperature of 50 °C, 
      using a 3:1 M ratio of DBCO-PEG:VHH-azide and an incubation time of 18 h. Second, we 
      show that stoichiometry was controllable with click chemistry and produced defined 
      conjugates, whereas maleimide-thiol conjugation resulted in diverse reaction 
      products. In addition, we show that all VHHs - independent of the conjugation method 
      or conjugated residue - still specifically bind their cognate antigen. Yet, VHH's 
      functional binding capacities after click chemistry were at least equal or better 
      than maleimide thiol conjugates. Together these data underline that click chemistry 
      is superior to maleimide-thiol conjugation for conjugating targeting ligands.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can mediate local and long-range intercellular 
      communication via cell surface signaling. In order to perform in vivo studies of 
      unmanipulated, endogenously released EVs, sensitive but stringent approaches able to 
      detect EV-cell surface interactions are needed. However, isolation and reinfusion of 
      EVs can introduce biases. A rigorous way to study EVs in vivo is by genetically 
      engineering membrane-bound reporters into parental cells. Still, the amount of 
      reporter molecules that EVs can carry is relatively small, and thus, the sensitivity 
      of the approach is suboptimal. This work addresses this issue by engineering EVs to 
      display a membrane-bound form of Sortase A (SrtA), a bacterial transpeptidase that 
      can catalyze the transfer of reporter molecules on the much bigger surface of 
      EV-binding cells. SrtA design and reaction requirements are optimized and validated. 
      Efficient in vitro labeling of EV-binding cells is achieved, even in the presence of 
      only one N-terminal glycine on cell surface proteins. As compared to indirect 
      labeling of EV-binding cells (e.g., using CD63-GFP fusion), the SrtA-based approach 
      shows 1-2 log increase in sensitivity, depending on the EV source. This novel 
      approach will be useful to identify and study the full set of host cells interacting 
      with native EVs in vivo.

LID - 10.1002/cbic.201700444 [doi]
AB  - Overexpression of (mutated) receptor tyrosine kinases is a characteristic of many 
      aggressive tumors, and induction of receptor uptake has long been recognized as a 
      therapeutic modality. A conjugate of a synthetically produced cell-penetrating 
      peptide (CPP), corresponding to amino acids 38-59 of human lactoferrin, and the 
      recombinant llama single-domain antibody (VHH) 7D12, which binds the human epidermal 
      growth factor receptor (EGFR), was generated by sortase A mediated transpeptidation. 
      The conjugate blocks EGF-mediated EGFR activation with higher efficacy than that of 
      both modalities alone; a phenomenon that is caused by both effective receptor 
      blockade and internalization. Thus, the VHH-CPP conjugate shows a combination of 
      activities that implement a highly powerful new design principle to block receptor 
      activation by its clearance from the cell surface.

TI  - Glycosylation of recombinant rabbit immunoglobulins influences protease 
      susceptibility as shown by comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan analysis.
PG  - 762-771
LID - 10.1093/glycob/cwab010 [doi]
AB  - Recombinant immunoglobulins (rIgGs) have become increasingly important as 
      therapeutic agents and diagnostic tools in recent years. Genetic engineering allows 
      the introduction of non-natural features such as the Sortase motif for site-directed 
      labeling. In this study, the enzyme Sortase A (SrtA) was used for the proteolytic 
      cleavage of rIgGs to produce their biotinylated Fab fragments by locating the 
      cleavage site close to the hinge region. However, SrtA cleavage of engineered rabbit 
      IgGs (rRb-IgGs) derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells showed 
      significantly lower yields compared with their mouse counterparts. Nonrecombinant 
      Rb-IgGs have N- and O-glycans, and the presence of O-glycans close to the hinge 
      region of the rRb-IgGs might affect the susceptibility of these antibodies to SrtA 
      cleavage. In addition, the glycosylation pattern of rIgGs differs depending on the 
      host cell used for expression. Therefore, we analyzed the N- and O-glycans of 
      various rRb-IgGs expressed in HEK293 cells, detecting and quantifying 13 different 
      N-glycan and 3 different O-glycan structures. The distribution of the different 
      detected glycoforms in our rRb-IgG N-glycan analysis is in agreement with previous 
      studies on recombinant human IgG N-glycans, confirming the hypothesis that the host 
      cell defines the glycosylation of the recombinant produced IgGs. O-glycosylation 
      could be mapped onto the threonine residue within the hinge region sequence 
      XPTCPPPX, as already described previously for nonrecombinant Rb-IgGs. Substitution 
      of this threonine allowed an almost complete Fab fragment cleavage. Therefore, we 
      could confirm the hypothesis that the O-glycans affect the SrtA activity, probably 
      due to steric hindrance.

TI  - pH-Controlled Protein Orthogonal Ligation Using Asparaginyl Peptide Ligases.
PG  - 8704-8712
LID - 10.1021/jacs.1c02638 [doi]
AB  - Peptide asparaginyl ligases (PALs) catalyze transpeptidation at the Asn residue of a 
      short Asn-Xaa(1)-Xaa(2) tripeptide motif. Due to their high catalytic activity 
      toward the P1-Asn substrates at around neutral pH, PALs have been used extensively 
      for peptide ligation at asparaginyl junctions. PALs also bind to aspartyl 
      substrates, but only when the (γ)COOH of P1-Asp remains in its neutral, protonated 
      form, which usually requires an acidic pH. However, this limits the availability of 
      the amine nucleophile and, consequently, the ligation efficiency at aspartyl 
      junctions. Because of this perceived inefficiency, the use of PALs for Asp-specific 
      ligation remains largely unexplored. We found that PAL enzymes, such as VyPAL2, 
      display appreciable catalytic activities toward P1-Asp substrates at pH 4-5, which 
      are at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of sortase A, making them 
      practically useful for both intra- and intermolecular ligations. This also allows 
      sequential ligations, first at Asp and then at Asn junctions, because the newly 
      formed aspartyl peptide bond is resistant to the ligase at the pH used for 
      asparaginyl ligation in the second step. Using this pH-controlled orthogonal 
      ligation method, we dually labeled truncated sfGFP with a cancer-targeting peptide 
      and a doxorubicin derivative at the respective N- and C-terminal ends in the N-to-C 
      direction. In addition, a fluorescein tag and doxorubicin derivative were tagged to 
      an EGFR-targeting affibody in the C-to-N direction. This study shows that the 
      pH-dependent catalytic activity of PAL enzymes can be exploited to prepare 
      multifunction protein biologics for pharmacological applications.

AB  - Fluorescently labeled proteins can improve the detection sensitivity and have been 
      widely used in a variety of biological measurements. In single-molecule assays, 
      site-specific labeling of proteins enables the visualization of molecular 
      interactions, conformational changes in proteins, and enzymatic activity. In this 
      study, based on a flexible linker in the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase, we 
      established a scheme involving a combination of fluorophore labeling and sortase A 
      ligation to allow site-specific labeling of the HRDC domain of RecQ with a single 
      Cy5 fluorophore, without inletting extra fluorescent domain or peptide fragment. 
      Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we visualized that 
      Cy5-labeled HRDC could directly interact with RecA domains and could bind to both 
      the 3' and 5' ends of the overhang DNA dynamically in vitro for the first time. The 
      present work not only reveals the functional mechanism of the HRDC domain, but also 
      provides a feasible method for site-specific labeling of a domain with a single 
      fluorophore used in single-molecule assays.

AB  - Orthopedic and dental implants are associated with a substantial risk of failure due 
      to biomaterial-associated infections and poor osseointegration. To prevent such 
      outcomes, a coating can be applied on the implant to ideally both reduce the risk of 
      bacterial adhesion and support establishment of osteoblasts. We present a strategy 
      to construct dual-functional silk coatings with such properties. Silk coatings were 
      made from a recombinant partial spider silk protein either alone (silk(wt)) or fused 
      with a cell-binding motif derived from fibronectin (FN-silk). The biofilm-dispersal 
      enzyme Dispersin B (DspB) and two peptidoglycan degrading endolysins, PlySs2 and 
      SAL-1, were produced recombinantly. A sortase recognition tag (SrtTag) was included 
      to allow site-specific conjugation of each enzyme onto silk(wt) and FN-silk coatings 
      using an engineered variant of the transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA*). To evaluate 
      bacterial adhesion on the samples, Staphylococcus aureus was incubated on the 
      coatings and subsequently subjected to live/dead staining. Fluorescence microscopy 
      revealed a reduced number of bacteria on all silk coatings containing enzymes. 
      Moreover, the bacteria were mobile to a higher degree, indicating a negative 
      influence on the bacterial adhesion. The capability to support mammalian cell 
      interactions was assessed by cultivation of the osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS on 
      dual-functional surfaces, prepared by conjugating the enzymes onto FN-silk coatings. 
      U-2 OS cells could adhere to silk coatings with enzymes and showed high spreading 
      and viability, demonstrating good cell compatibility.

TI  - Segmental, Domain-Selective Perdeuteration and Small-Angle Neutron Scattering for 
      Structural Analysis of Multi-Domain Proteins.
PG  - 9322-9325
LID - 10.1002/anie.201702904 [doi]
AB  - Multi-domain proteins play critical roles in fine-tuning essential processes in 
      cellular signaling and gene regulation. Typically, multiple globular domains that 
      are connected by flexible linkers undergo dynamic rearrangements upon binding to 
      protein, DNA or RNA ligands. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) represent an important 
      class of multi-domain proteins, which regulate gene expression by recognizing linear 
      or structured RNA sequence motifs. Here, we employ segmental perdeuteration of the 
      three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains in the RBP TIA-1 using Sortase A mediated 
      protein ligation. We show that domain-selective perdeuteration combined with 
      contrast-matched small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), SAXS and computational 
      modeling provides valuable information to precisely define relative domain 
      arrangements. The approach is generally applicable to study conformational 
      arrangements of individual domains in multi-domain proteins and changes induced by 
      ligand binding.

AB  - Surface display of engineered proteins has many useful applications. The expression 
      of a synthetic chimeric antigen receptor composed of an extracellular tumor-specific 
      antibody fragment linked to a cytosolic activating motif in engineered T cells is 
      now considered a viable approach for the treatment of leukemias. The risk of de novo 
      tumor development, inherent in the transfer of genetically engineered cells, calls 
      for alternative approaches for the functionalization of the lymphocyte plasma 
      membrane. We demonstrate the conjugation of LPXTG-tagged probes and LPXTG-bearing 
      proteins to endogenous acceptors at the plasma membrane in a single step using 
      sortase A. We successfully conjugated biotin probes not only to mouse hematopoietic 
      cells but also to yeast cells, 293T cells, and Toxoplasma gondii. Installation of 
      single domain antibodies on activated CD8 T cell redirects cell-specific 
      cytotoxicity to cells that bear the relevant antigen. Likewise, conjugation of 
      Toxoplasma gondii with single domain antibodies targets the pathogen to cells that 
      express the antigen recognized by these single domain antibodies. This simple and 
      robust enzymatic approach enables engineering of the plasma membrane for research or 
      therapy under physiological reaction conditions that ensure the viability of the 
      modified cells.

TI  - GlyGly-CTERM and rhombosortase: a C-terminal protein processing signal in a 
      many-to-one pairing with a rhomboid family intramembrane serine protease.
PG  - e28886
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0028886 [doi]
LID - e28886
AB  - The rhomboid family of serine proteases occurs in all domains of life. Its members 
      contain at least six hydrophobic membrane-spanning helices, with an active site 
      serine located deep within the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane. The 
      model member GlpG from Escherichia coli is heavily studied through engineered mutant 
      forms, varied model substrates, and multiple X-ray crystal studies, yet its 
      relationship to endogenous substrates is not well understood. Here we describe an 
      apparent membrane anchoring C-terminal homology domain that appears in numerous 
      genera including Shewanella, Vibrio, Acinetobacter, and Ralstonia, but excluding 
      Escherichia and Haemophilus. Individual genomes encode up to thirteen members, 
      usually homologous to each other only in this C-terminal region. The domain's 
      tripartite architecture consists of motif, transmembrane helix, and cluster of basic 
      residues at the protein C-terminus, as also seen with the LPXTG recognition sequence 
      for sortase A and the PEP-CTERM recognition sequence for exosortase. Partial 
      Phylogenetic Profiling identifies a distinctive rhomboid-like protease subfamily 
      almost perfectly co-distributed with this recognition sequence. This protease 
      subfamily and its putative target domain are hereby renamed rhombosortase and 
      GlyGly-CTERM, respectively. The protease and target are encoded by consecutive genes 
      in most genomes with just a single target, but far apart otherwise. The signature 
      motif of the Rhombo-CTERM domain, often SGGS, only partially resembles known 
      cleavage sites of rhomboid protease family model substrates. Some protein families 
      that have several members with C-terminal GlyGly-CTERM domains also have additional 
      members with LPXTG or PEP-CTERM domains instead, suggesting there may be common 
      themes to the post-translational processing of these proteins by three different 
      membrane protein superfamilies.

TI  - Prediction of DtxR regulon: identification of binding sites and operons controlled 
      by Diphtheria toxin repressor in Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
PG  - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diphtheria toxin repressor, DtxR, of Corynebacterium diphtheriae has 
      been shown to be an iron-activated transcription regulator that controls not only 
      the expression of diphtheria toxin but also of iron uptake genes. This study aims to 
      identify putative binding sites and operons controlled by DtxR to understand the 
      role of DtxR in patho-physiology of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. RESULT: Positional 
      Shannon relative entropy method was used to build the DtxR-binding site recognition 
      profile and the later was used to identify putative regulatory sites of DtxR within 
      C. diphtheriae genome. In addition, DtxR-regulated operons were also identified 
      taking into account the predicted DtxR regulatory sites and genome annotation. Few 
      of the predicted motifs were experimentally validated by electrophoretic mobility 
      shift assay. The analysis identifies motifs upstream to the novel iron-regulated 
      genes that code for Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (FpG), an enzyme involved in 
      DNA-repair and starvation inducible DNA-binding protein (Dps) which is involved in 
      iron storage and oxidative stress defense. In addition, we have found the DtxR 
      motifs upstream to the genes that code for sortase which catalyzes anchoring of 
      host-interacting proteins to the cell wall of pathogenic bacteria and the proteins 
      of secretory system which could be involved in translocation of various 
      iron-regulated virulence factors including diphtheria toxin. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      used an in silico approach to identify the putative binding sites and genes 
      controlled by DtxR in Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Our analysis shows that DtxR 
      could provide a molecular link between Fe+2-induced Fenton's reaction and protection 
      of DNA from oxidative damage. DtxR-regulated Dps prevents lethal combination of Fe+2 
      and H2O2 and also protects DNA by nonspecific DNA-binding. In addition DtxR could 
      play an important role in host interaction and virulence by regulating the levels of 
      sortase, a potential vaccine candidate and proteins of secretory system.

TI  - Evaluation of the Function of Probiotics, Emphasizing the Role of their Binding to 
      the Intestinal Epithelium in the Stability and their Effects on the Immune System.

AB  - Due to the importance of using cost-effective methods for therapeutic purposes, the 
      function of probiotics as safe microorganisms and the study of their relevant 
      functional mechanisms have recently been in the spotlight. Finding the mechanisms of 
      attachment and stability and their beneficial effects on the immune system can be 
      useful in identifying and increasing the therapeutic effects of probiotics. In this 
      review, the functional mechanisms of probiotics were comprehensively investigated. 
      Relevant articles were searched in scientific sources, documents, and databases, 
      including PubMed, NCBI, Bactibace, OptiBac, and Bagel4. The most important 
      functional mechanisms of probiotics and their effects on strengthening the 
      epithelial barrier, competitive inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms, production 
      of antimicrobials, binding and interaction with the host, and regulatory effects on 
      the immune system were discussed.In this regard, the attachment of probiotics to the 
      epithelium is very important because the prerequisite for their proper functioning 
      is to establish a proper connection to the epithelium. Therefore, more attention 
      should be paid to the binding effect of probiotics, including sortase A, a 
      significant factor involved in the expression of sortase-dependent proteins (SDP), 
      on their surface as mediators of intestinal epithelial cell binding. In general, by 
      investigating the functional mechanisms of probiotics, it was concluded that the 
      mechanism by which probiotics regulate the immune system and adhesion capacity can 
      directly and indirectly have preventive and therapeutic effects on a wide range of 
      diseases. However, further study of these mechanisms requires extensive research on 
      various aspects.

AB  - Transpeptidation of surface proteins catalyzed by the transpeptidase sortase plays a 
      critical role in the infection process of Gram-positive pathogen. Monitoring sortase 
      activity and screening its inhibitors are of great significance to fundamental 
      understanding of the infection mechanism and pharmaceutical development. Herein, we 
      developed a digital single-particle imaging method to quantify sortase A (SrtA) 
      activity based on transpeptidation-mediated assembly and enumeration of gold 
      nanoparticles (GNPs). The assay utilizes two peptide stands, in which one has the 
      SrtA recognition sequence LPXTG motif while the other carries an oligoglycine 
      nucleophile at the one end and a biotin group at the other. The presence of SrtA 
      enables the ligation of two peptides and allows for the immobilization of 
      streptavidin-functionalized GNPs. Thus, SrtA activity can be quantified by imaging 
      and enumeration of the surface-assembled GNPs at the single-particle level via 
      dark-field microscopy. The single-particle method was highly sensitive to SrtA 
      activity with a low detection limit of 7.9 pM and a wide linear dynamic range from 
      0.05 to 50 nM. Besides detection of SrtA in complex biological samples such as 
      Gram-positive pathogen lysates, the proposed method was also successfully applied to 
      estimate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of SrtA 
      inhibitors (curcumin, berberine hydrochloride and quercetin). The present method, 
      combining single-GNP counting and dark-field imaging, provides a facile and novel 
      analytical tool for SrtA activity and its inhibitor screening.

TI  - Effect of Adiantum philippense Extract on Biofilm Formation, Adhesion With Its 
      Antibacterial Activities Against Foodborne Pathogens, and Characterization of 
      Bioactive Metabolites: An in vitro-in silico Approach.
PG  - 823

AB  - Adiantum philippense (A. philippense), an ethnomedicinally important fern, has 
      become an interesting herb in the search for novel bioactive metabolites, which can 
      also be used as therapeutic agents. Primarily, in this study, A. philippense crude 
      extract was screened for its phytochemical constituents, antagonistic potential, and 
      effect on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation against common food pathogens. 
      Phytochemical profiling of A. philippense was carried out by using High 
      Resolution-Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy (HR-LCMS) followed by 
      antibacterial activity via agar cup/well diffusion, broth microdilution 
      susceptibility methods, and growth curve analysis. Antibiofilm potency and efficacy 
      were assessed on the development, formation, and texture of biofilms through light 
      microscopy, fluorescent microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and the assessment 
      of exopolysaccharide production. Correspondingly, a checkerboard test was performed 
      to evaluate the combinatorial effect of A. philippense and chloramphenicol. Lastly, 
      molecular docking studies of identified phytochemicals with adhesin proteins of 
      tested food pathogens, which helps the bacteria in surface attachment and leads to 
      biofilm formation, were assessed. A. philippense crude extract was found to be 
      active against all tested food pathogens, displaying the rapid time-dependent 
      kinetics of bacterial killing. A. philippense crude extract also impedes the biofilm 
      matrix by reducing the total content of exopolysaccharide, and, likewise, the 
      microscopic images revealed a great extent of disruption in the architecture of 
      biofilms. A synergy was observed between A. philippense crude extract and 
      chloramphenicol for E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa, whereas an additive 
      effect was observed for S. flexneri. Various bioactive phytochemicals were 
      categorized from A. philippense crude extract using HR-LCMS. The molecular docking 
      of these identified phytochemicals was interrelated with the active site residues of 
      adhesin proteins, IcsA, Sortase A, OprD, EspA, and FimH from S. flexneri, S. aureus, 
      P. aeruginosa, and E. coli, respectively. Thus, our findings represent the 
      bioactivity and potency of A. philippense crude extract against food pathogens not 
      only in their planktonic forms but also against/in biofilms for the first time. We 
      have also correlated these findings with the possible mechanism of biofilm 
      inhibition via targeting adhesin proteins, which could be explored further to design 
      new bioactive compounds against biofilm producing foodborne bacterial pathogens.

PG  - 1574-9
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1317181111 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is anchored to the cell wall envelope of 
      Staphylococcus aureus by sortase A, which links the threonyl (T) of its C-terminal 
      LPXTG motif to peptidoglycan cross-bridges (i.e., Gly5). SpA binds the Fcγ domains 
      of IgG and protects staphylococci from opsonophagocytic clearance. Moreover, SpA 
      cross-links B-cell receptors to modify host adaptive immune responses. The 
      mechanisms whereby SpA is released from the bacterial surface to access the host's 
      immune system are not known. Here we demonstrate that SpA is released with murein 
      tetrapeptide-tetraglycyl [L-Ala-D-iGln-(SpA-Gly5)L-Lys-D-Ala-Gly4] linked to its 
      C-terminal threonyl. LytN, a cross-wall murein hydrolase, contributes to the release 
      of SpA by removing amino sugars [i.e., N-acetylmuramic acid-N-acetylglucosamine 
      (MurNAc-GlcNAc)] from attached peptidoglycan, whereas LytM, a 
      pentaglycyl-endopeptidase, triggers polypeptide release from the bacterial envelope. 
      A model is proposed whereby murein hydrolases cleave the anchor structure of 
      released SpA to modify host immune responses.

TI  - Extracellular nucleotide catabolism by the Group B Streptococcus ectonucleotidase 
      NudP increases bacterial survival in blood.

AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is a commensal of the human 
      intestine and vagina of adult women but is the leading cause of invasive infection 
      in neonates. This Gram-positive bacterium displays a set of virulence-associated 
      surface proteins involved in the interaction with the host, such as adhesion to host 
      cells, invasion of tissues, or subversion of the immune system. In this study, we 
      characterized a cell wall-localized protein as an ecto-5'-nucleoside diphosphate 
      phosphohydrolase (NudP) involved in the degradation of extracellular nucleotides 
      which are central mediators of the immune response. Biochemical characterization of 
      recombinant NudP revealed a Mn(2+)-dependent ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity on ribo- 
      and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-mono- and 5'-diphosphates with a substrate specificity 
      different from that of known orthologous enzymes. Deletion of the gene coding the 
      housekeeping enzyme sortase A led to the release of NudP into the culture 
      supernatant, confirming that this enzyme is anchored to the cell wall by its 
      non-canonical LPXTN motif. The NudP ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity is reminiscent of 
      the reactions performed by the mammalian ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 involved in 
      regulating the extracellular level of ATP and adenosine. We further demonstrated 
      that the absence of NudP activity decreases bacterial survival in mouse blood, a 
      process dependent on extracellular adenosine. In vivo assays in animal models of 
      infection showed that NudP activity is critical for virulence. These results 
      demonstrate that Group B Streptococcus expresses a specific ecto-5'-nucleotidase 
      necessary for its pathogenicity and highlight the diversity of reactions performed 
      by this enzyme family. These results suggest that bacterial pathogens have developed 
      specialized strategies to subvert the mammalian immune response controlled by the 
      extracellular nucleotide signaling pathways.

TI  - Exendin 4-Hapten Conjugate Capable of Binding with Endogenous Antibodies for Peptide 
      Half-life Extension and Exerting Long-Acting Hypoglycemic Activity.
PG  - 4947-4959
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00032 [doi]
AB  - Hapten-specific endogenous antibodies are naturally occurring antibodies present in 
      human blood. Herein, we investigated a new strategy in which small-molecule haptens 
      were utilized as naturally occurring antibody binders for peptide half-life 
      extension. The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist exendin 4 was 
      site-specifically functionalized with the dinitrophenyl (DNP) hapten at the 
      C-terminus via sortase A-mediated ligation. The resulting Ex4-DNP conjugates 
      retained GLP-1 receptor activation potency in vitro and had a similar in vivo acute 
      glucose-lowering effect comparable to that of native Ex4. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      and hypoglycemic duration tests demonstrated that the Ex4-DNP conjugates displayed 
      significantly elongated half-lives and improved long-acting antidiabetic activity in 
      the presence of endogenous anti-DNP antibodies. In chronic treatment studies, 
      once-daily administration of optimal conjugate 7 demonstrated more beneficial 
      effects without prominent toxicity compared with Ex4. This strategy provides a new 
      approach and represents an alternative to the well-established peptide-Fc fusion 
      strategy to improve the peptide half-life and the therapeutic efficacy.

      Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - The increase in the incidence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. 
      aureus) associated infections necessitates the urgent development of novel 
      therapeutic strategies and antibacterial drugs. Antivirulence strategy is an 
      especially compelling alternative strategy due to its low selective pressure for the 
      development of drug resistance in bacteria. Plants and microorganisms are not only 
      important food and medicinal resources but also serve as sources for the discovery 
      of natural products that target bacterial virulence factors. This review discusses 
      the mechanisms of the major virulence factors of S. aureus, including the accessory 
      gene regulator quorum-sensing system, bacterial biofilm formation, α-hemolysin, 
      sortase A, and staphyloxanthin. We also provide an overview of natural products 
      isolated from plants and microorganisms with activity against the major virulence 
      factors of S. aureus and their adjuvant effects on existing antibiotics to overcome 
      antibiotic-resistant S. aureus. Finally, the limitations and solutions of these 
      antivirulence compounds are discussed, which will help in the development of novel 
      antibacterial drugs against antibiotic-resistant S. aureus.

AB  - While conventional antibodies have been an instrument of choice in 
      immunocytochemistry for some time, their small counterparts known as nanobodies have 
      been much less frequently used for this purpose. In this study we took advantage of 
      the availability of nanobody cDNAs to site-specifically introduce a non-standard 
      amino acid carrying an azide/alkyne moiety, allowing subsequent Cu(I)-catalyzed 
      Azide-Alkyne Click Chemistry (CuAAC). This generated a fluorescently labelled 
      nanobody that can be used in single step immunocytochemistry as compared to 
      conventional two step immunocytochemistry. Two strategies were explored to label 
      nanobodies with Alexa Fluor 488. The first involved enzymatic addition of an 
      alkyne-containing peptide to nanobodies using sortase A, while the second consisted 
      of incorporating para-azido phenylalanine at the nanobody C-terminus. Through these 
      approaches, the fluorophore was covalently and site-specifically attached. It was 
      demonstrated that cortactin and β-catenin, cytoskeletal and adherens junction 
      proteins respectively, can be imaged in cells in this manner through single step 
      immunocytochemistry. However, fixation and permeabilization of cells can alter 
      native protein structure and form a dense cross-linked protein network, encumbering 
      antibody binding. It was shown that photoporation prior to fixation not only allowed 
      delivery of nanobodies into living cells, but also facilitated β-catenin nanobody 
      Nb86 imaging of its target, which was not possible in fixed cells. Pharmacological 
      inhibitors are lacking for many non-enzymatic proteins, and it is therefore expected 
      that new biological information will be obtained through photoporation of 
      fluorescent nanobodies, which allows the study of short term effects, independent of 
      gene-dependent (intrabody) expression.

TI  - Variable region in streptococcal M-proteins provides stable binding with host

PG  - 6775-6785
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M116.768937 [doi]
AB  - Dimeric M-proteins (M-Prt) in group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) are 
      surface-expressed virulence factors implicated in processes that contribute to the 
      pathogenicity of infection. Sequence analyses of various GAS M-Prts have shown that 
      they contain a highly conserved sortase A-dependent cell wall-anchored C terminus, 
      whereas the surface-exposed N terminus is highly variable, a feature used for 
      identification and serotyping of various GAS strains. This variability also allows 
      for strain-specific responses that suppress host defenses. Previous studies have 
      indeed identified the N-terminal M-Prt B-domain as the site interacting with 
      antiphagocytotic human-host fibrinogen (hFg). Herein, we show that hFg strongly 
      interacts with M-Prts containing highly variable B-domains. We further demonstrate 
      that specific GAS clinical isolates display high affinity for the D-domain of hFg, 
      and this interaction allowed for subsequent surface binding of human-host 
      plasminogen (hPg) to the E-domain of hFg. This GAS surface-bound hPg is then 
      activated by GAS-secreted streptokinase, leading to the generation of an invasive 
      proteolytic bacterial surface. Our results underscore the importance of the human 
      fibrinolytic system in host-pathogen interactions in invasive GAS infections.

TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis Type IX Secretion Substrates Are Cleaved and Modified by a 
      Sortase-Like Mechanism.
PG  - e1005152

AB  - The type IX secretion system (T9SS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis secretes proteins 
      possessing a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) to the cell surface. The C-terminal 
      signal is essential for these proteins to translocate across the outer membrane via 
      the T9SS. On the surface the CTD of these proteins is cleaved prior to extensive 
      glycosylation. It is believed that the modification on these CTD proteins is anionic 
      lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS), which enables the attachment of CTD proteins to the cell 
      surface. However, the exact site of modification and the mechanism of attachment of 
      CTD proteins to the cell surface are unknown. In this study we characterized two 
      wbaP (PG1964) mutants that did not synthesise A-LPS and accumulated CTD proteins in 
      the clarified culture fluid (CCF). The CTDs of the CTD proteins in the CCF were 
      cleaved suggesting normal secretion, however, the CTD proteins were not 
      glycosylated. Mass spectrometric analysis of CTD proteins purified from the CCF of 
      the wbaP mutants revealed the presence of various peptide/amino acid modifications 
      from the growth medium at the C-terminus of the mature CTD proteins. This suggested 
      that modification occurs at the C-terminus of T9SS substrates in the wild type P. 
      gingivalis. This was confirmed by analysis of CTD proteins from wild type, where a 
      648 Da linker was identified to be attached at the C-terminus of mature CTD 
      proteins. Importantly, treatment with proteinase K released the 648 Da linker from 
      the CTD proteins demonstrating a peptide bond between the C-terminus and the 
      modification. Together, this is suggestive of a mechanism similar to sortase A for 
      the cleavage and modification/attachment of CTD proteins in P. gingivalis. PG0026 
      has been recognized as the CTD signal peptidase and is now proposed to be the 
      sortase-like protein in P. gingivalis. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      biochemical evidence suggesting a sortase-like mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria.

      Hybridoma Engineering.
PG  - 301-310

AB  - Functionalized antibodies and antibody fragments have found applications in the 
      fields of biomedical imaging, theranostics, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). In 
      addition, therapeutic and theranostic approaches benefit from the possibility to 
      deliver more than one type of cargo to target cells, further challenging stochastic 
      labeling strategies. Thus, bioconjugation methods to reproducibly obtain defined 
      homogeneous conjugates bearing multiple different cargo molecules, without 
      compromising target affinity, are in demand. Here, we describe a straightforward 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy to rapidly engineer hybridoma cells to secrete Fab' 
      fragments bearing two distinct site-specific labeling motifs, which can be 
      separately modified by two different sortase A mutants. We show that sequential 
      genetic editing of the heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) loci enables the 
      generation of a stable cell line that secretes a dual tagged Fab' molecule (DTFab'), 
      which can be easily isolated. To demonstrate feasibility, we functionalized the 
      DTFab' with two distinct cargos in a site-specific manner. This technology platform 
      will be valuable in the development of multimodal imaging agents, theranostics, and 
      next-generation ADCs.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus mutants lacking the LytR-CpsA-Psr family of enzymes release 
      cell wall teichoic acids into the extracellular medium.
PG  - 4650-9
LID - 10.1128/JB.00544-13 [doi]
AB  - The LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) proteins are thought to transfer bactoprenol-linked 
      biosynthetic intermediates of wall teichoic acid (WTA) to the peptidoglycan of 
      Gram-positive bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis, mutants lacking all three LCP enzymes 
      do not deposit WTA in the envelope, while Staphylococcus aureus Δlcp mutants display 
      impaired growth and reduced levels of envelope phosphate. We show here that the S. 
      aureus Δlcp mutant synthesized WTA yet released ribitol phosphate polymers into the 
      extracellular medium. Further, Δlcp mutant staphylococci no longer restricted the 
      deposition of LysM-type murein hydrolases to cell division sites, which was 
      associated with defects in cell shape and increased autolysis. Mutations in S. 
      aureus WTA synthesis genes (tagB, tarF, or tarJ2) inhibit growth, which is 
      attributed to the depletion of bactoprenol, an essential component of peptidoglycan 
      synthesis (lipid II). The growth defect of S. aureus tagB and tarFJ mutants was 
      alleviated by inhibition of WTA synthesis with tunicamycin, whereas the growth 
      defect of the Δlcp mutant was not relieved by tunicamycin treatment or by mutation 
      of tagO, whose product catalyzes the first committed step of WTA synthesis. Further, 
      sortase A-mediated anchoring of proteins to peptidoglycan, which also involves 
      bactoprenol and lipid II, was not impaired in the Δlcp mutant. We propose a model 
      whereby the S. aureus Δlcp mutant, defective in tethering WTA to the cell wall, 
      cleaves WTA synthesis intermediates, releasing ribitol phosphate into the medium and 
      recycling bactoprenol for peptidoglycan synthesis.

AB  - Despite the potential of anti-thrombogenic coatings, including heparinized surfaces, 
      to improve the performance of blood-contacting devices, the inevitable deterioration 
      of bioactivity remains an important factor in device failure and related thrombotic 
      complications. As a consequence, the ability to restore the bioactivity of a surface 
      coating after implantation of a blood-contacting device provides a potentially 
      important strategy to enhance its clinical performance. Here, we report the 
      regeneration of a multicomponent anti-thrombogenic coating through use of an evolved 
      sortase A to mediate reversible transpeptidation. Both recombinant thrombomodulin 
      and a chemoenzymatically synthesized ultra-low molecular weight heparin were 
      repeatedly and selectively immobilized or removed in a sequential, alternating, or 
      simultaneous manner. The generation of activated protein C (aPC) and inhibition of 
      activated factor X (FXa) was consistent with the molecular composition of the 
      surface. The fabrication of a rechargeable anti-thrombogenic surface was 
      demonstrated on an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular graft with 
      reconstitution of the surface bound coating 4 weeks after in vivo implantation in a 
      rat model.

AB  - Despite the significant therapeutic advances in T-cell immunotherapy, many 
      malignancies remain unresponsive, which might be because of the negative regulation 
      of T cells by the tumor microenvironment (TME). T cells discriminate tumor cells and 
      normal cells through T-cell receptors (TCRs); therefore, we generated a novel type 
      of TCR-drug conjugates (TDCs) by referring antibody-drug conjugations (ADCs) to 
      overcome the effects of the TME on T cells while preserving the specificity of TCR 
      for tumor recognition. We selected HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1(157-165) (peptide 
      NY-ESO-1(157-165) in complex with human leukocyte antigen serotype HLA-A*02:01) as 
      the antigen and the antigen-specific TCR (1G4113) as the carrier. By sortase 
      A-mediated ligation, we obtained three NY-TCR-vcMMAEs and further studied their 
      properties, antitumor activity, and toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We found that all 
      the NY-TCR-vcMMAEs had high endocytosis efficiency and specifically killed 
      HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1(157-165) positive tumor cells. In xenograft models, one of the TDCs, 
      NY-TCR-2M, was effectively and specifically distributed into tumor tissues and 
      inhibited tumor growth without inducing obvious toxicity. Our results demonstrated 
      that TCRs can be carriers of toxic payloads and that the TDCs thus formed can 
      specifically inhibit tumor growth, neglecting the immune microenvironment.

TI  - Enzymatic Ligation of a Pore Blocker Toxin and a Gating Modifier Toxin: Creating 
      Double-Knotted Peptides with Improved Sodium Channel Na(V)1.7 Inhibition.
PG  - 64-73
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00744 [doi]
AB  - Disulfide-rich animal venom peptides targeting either the voltage-sensing domain or 
      the pore domain of voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Na(V)1.7) have been widely 
      studied as drug leads and pharmacological probes for the treatment of chronic pain. 
      However, despite intensive research efforts, the full potential of Na(V)1.7 as a 
      therapeutic target is yet to be realized. In this study, using evolved sortase A, we 
      enzymatically ligated two known Na(V)1.7 inhibitors-PaurTx3, a spider-derived 
      peptide toxin that modifies the gating mechanism of the channel through interaction 
      with the voltage-sensing domain, and KIIIA, a small cone snail-derived peptide 
      inhibitor of the pore domain-with the aim of creating a bivalent inhibitor which 
      could interact simultaneously with two noncompeting binding sites. Using 
      electrophysiology, we determined the activity at Na(V)1.7, and to maximize potency, 
      we systematically evaluated the optimal linker length, which was nine amino acids. 
      Our optimized synthetic bivalent peptide showed improved channel affinity and 
      potency at Na(V)1.7 compared to either PaurTx3 or KIIIA individually. This work 
      shows that novel and improved Na(V)1.7 inhibitors can be designed by combining a 
      pore blocker toxin and a gating modifier toxin to confer desired pharmacological 
      properties from both the voltage sensing domain and the pore domain.

TI  - New Unnatural Gallotannins: A Way toward Green Antioxidants, Antimicrobials and 
      Antibiofilm Agents.
LID - 10.3390/antiox10081288 [doi]
LID - 1288
AB  - Nature has been a source of inspiration for the development of new pharmaceutically 
      active agents. A series of new unnatural gallotannins (GTs), derived from d-lyxose, 
      d-ribose, l-rhamnose, d-mannose, and d-fructose have been designed and synthesized 
      in order to study the protective and antimicrobial effects of synthetic polyphenols 
      that are structurally related to plant-derived products. The structures of the new 
      compounds were confirmed by various spectroscopic methods. Apart from spectral 
      analysis, the antioxidant activity was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl 
      (DPPH) radical-scavenging and iron reducing power (FRAP) assays. Antibacterial 
      activity of compounds was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 
      Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (reference and control strains), three 
      methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus, and three isolates of 
      vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis. For screening of antimycobacterial effect, a 
      virulent isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and two non-tuberculous mycobacteria 
      were used. Furthermore, antibiofilm activity of structurally different GTs against 
      S. aureus, and their ability to inhibit sortase A, were inspected. Experimental data 
      revealed that the studied GTs are excellent antioxidants and radical-scavenging 
      agents. The compounds exhibited only a moderate antibacterial effect against 
      Gram-positive pathogens S. aureus and E. faecalis and were practically inactive 
      against mycobacteria. However, they were efficient inhibitors and disruptors of S. 
      aureus biofilms in sub-MIC concentrations, and interacted with the quorum-sensing 
      system in Chromobacteriumviolaceum. Overall, these findings suggest that synthetic 
      GTs could be considered as promising candidates for pharmacological, biomedical, 
      consumer products, and for food industry applications.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nose, throat, skin, and gastrointestinal (GI) 
      tract of humans. GI carriage of S. aureus is difficult to eradicate and has been 
      shown to facilitate the transmission of the bacterium among individuals. Although 
      staphylococcal colonization of the GI tract is asymptomatic, it increases the 
      likelihood of infection, particularly skin and soft tissue infections caused by 
      USA300 isolates. We established a mouse model of persistent S. aureus GI 
      colonization and characterized the impact of selected surface antigens on 
      colonization. In competition experiments, an acapsular mutant colonized better than 
      the parental strain Newman, whereas mutants defective in sortase A and clumping 
      factor A showed impaired ability to colonize the GI tract. Mutants lacking protein 
      A, clumping factor B, poly-N-acetyl glucosamine, or SdrCDE showed no defect in 
      colonization. An S. aureus wall teichoic acid (WTA) mutant (ΔtagO) failed to 
      colonize the mouse nose or GI tract, and the tagO and clfA mutants showed reduced 
      adherence in vitro to intestinal epithelial cells. The tagO mutant was recovered in 
      lower numbers than the wild type strain in the murine stomach and duodenum 1 h after 
      inoculation. This reduced fitness correlated with the in vitro susceptibility of the 
      tagO mutant to bile salts, proteases, and a gut-associated defensin. Newman ΔtagO 
      showed enhanced susceptibility to autolysis, and an autolysin (atl) tagO double 
      mutant abrogated this phenotype. However, the atl tagO mutant did not survive better 
      in the mouse GI tract than the tagO mutant. Our results indicate that the failure of 
      the tagO mutant to colonize the GI tract correlates with its poor adherence and 
      susceptibility to bactericidal factors within the mouse gut, but not to enhanced 
      activity of its major autolysin.

AB  - Efficient purification is crucial to providing large quantities of recombinant 
      therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies and cytokines. However, affinity 
      techniques for manufacturing protein therapeutics that use biomolecule-conjugated 
      agarose beads that harness specific biomolecular interactions suffer from issues 
      related to protein denaturation, contamination and the need to maintain 
      biomolecule-specific conditions for efficient protein capture. Here, we report a 
      versatile and scalable method for the purification of recombinant protein 
      therapeutics. The method exploits the high-affinity and controllable host-guest 
      interactions between cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and selected guests such as 
      adamantylammonium. We show that the Herceptin (the brand name of trastuzumab, a 
      monoclonal antibody drug used to treat breast cancer) and the much smaller cytokine 
      interferon α-2a can be purified by site-specifically tagging them with 
      adamantylammonium using the enzyme sortase A, followed by high-affinity binding with 
      CB[7]-conjugated agarose beads and the recovery of the protein using a guest with a 
      stronger affinity for CB[7]. The thermal and chemical stability of CB[7] beads and 
      their scalability, recyclability and low cost may also make them advantageous for 
      the manufacturing of biosimilars.

TI  - Recombinant Butelase-Mediated Cyclization of the p53-Binding Domain of the

      Investigation.
PG  - 3005-3015

AB  - Cyclization of the polypeptide backbone has proven to be a powerful strategy for 
      enhancing protein stability for fundamental research and pharmaceutical application. 
      The use of such an approach is restricted by how well a targeted polypeptide can be 
      efficiently ligated. Recently, an Asx-specific peptide ligase identified from a 
      tropical cyclotide-producing plant and named butelase 1 exhibited excellent 
      cyclization kinetics that cannot be matched by other known ligases, including 
      intein, PATG, PCY1, and sortase A. In this work, we aimed to examine whether 
      butelase 1 facilitated protein conformational stability for structural 
      investigation. First, we successfully expressed recombinant butelase 1 (rBTase) in 
      the yeast Pichia pastoris. Next, rBTase was shown to be highly efficient in the 
      cyclization of the p53-binding domain (N-terminal domain) of murine double minute X 
      (N-MdmX), an important target for designing anticancer drugs. The cyclized N-MdmX 
      (cMdmX) exhibited increased conformational stability and improved interaction with 
      the ligand compared with those of noncyclized N-MdmX. Importantly, the thermal 
      melting process was completely reversible, contrary to noncyclized N-MdmX, and the 
      melting temperature ( T(m)) of cMdmX was increased to 47 from 43 °C. This stable 
      conformation of cMdmX was further confirmed by (15)N-(1)H heteronuclear 
      single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The complex 
      of cMdmX and the ligand was tested for protein crystallization, and several 
      promising findings were revealed. Therefore, our work not only provides a 
      recombinant version of butelase 1 but also suggests a conventional approach for 
      preparing stable protein samples for both protein crystallization and NMR structural 
      investigation.

AB  - Phage-borne peptides and antibody fragments isolated from phage display libraries 
      have proven to be versatile and valuable reagents for immunoassay development. Due 
      to the lack of convenient and mild-condition methods for the labeling of the phage 
      particles, isolated peptide/protein affinity ligands are commonly removed from the 
      viral particles and conjugated to protein tracers or nanoparticles for analytical 
      use. This abolishes the advantage of isolating ready-to-use affinity binders and 
      creates the risk of affecting the polypeptide activity. To circumvent this problem, 
      we optimized the phage display system to produce phage particles that express the 
      affinity binder on pIII and a polyglycine short peptide fused to pVIII that allows 
      the covalent attachment of tracer molecules employing sortase A. Using a llama heavy 
      chain only variable domain (VHH) against the herbicide 2,4-D on pIII as the model, 
      we showed that the phage can be extensively decorated with a rhodamine-LPETGG 
      peptide conjugate or the protein nanoluciferase (Nluc) equipped with a C-terminal 
      LPETGG peptide. The maximum labeling amounts of rhodamine-LPETGG and Nluc-LPETGG 
      were 1238 ± 63 and 102 ± 16 per phage, respectively. The Nluc-labeled dual display 
      phage was employed to develop a phage bioluminescent immunoassay (P-BLEIA) for the 
      detection of 2,4-D. The limit of detection and 50% inhibition concentration of 
      P-BLEIA were 0.491 and 2.15 ng mL(-1), respectively, which represent 16-fold and 
      8-fold improvement compared to the phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In 
      addition, the P-BLEIA showed good accuracy for the detection of 2,4-D in spiked 
      samples.

TI  - Targeted Delivery of Cyclotides via Conjugation to a Nanobody.
PG  - 2973-2980
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.8b00653 [doi]
AB  - Many naturally occurring peptides have poor proteolytic stability, which limits 
      their therapeutic applications. Cyclotides are plant-derived cyclic peptides that 
      resist proteolysis due to their highly constrained structure, comprising a 
      head-to-tail cyclic backbone and three disulfide bonds that form a cystine-knotted 
      core. This structure makes them useful as scaffolds onto which peptide sequences 
      (epitopes) can be grafted. In this study, VHH7, an alpaca-derived nanobody that 
      targets murine class II MHC molecules, was used for the targeted delivery of 
      cyclotides to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The cyclotides MCoTI-I, and MCoTI-I 
      with a HA-tag (YPYDVPDYA) grafted into loop 6 (MCoTI-HA), were tested for 
      immunogenic properties. To produce the requisite VHH7-peptide conjugates, a 
      site-specific sortase A-catalyzed reaction in combination with a copper-free 
      strain-promoted cycloaddition reaction was used. MCoTI-I alone did not display any 
      obvious antibody response, thus showing the capacity of cyclotides as 
      immunologically silent scaffolds. By contrast, MCoTI-I conjugated to VHH7 elicited 
      antibodies against cyclic or linear MCoTI-I, thus suggesting a simple and robust 
      approach for targeting cyclotides to APCs, and potentially to other cell types. A 
      similar antibody response was observed when MCoTI-HA was conjugated to VHH7, but 
      there was no reactivity toward a linear HA-tag itself, suggesting differences in 
      conformational constraint between cyclotide-presented and linear epitopes. Studies 
      of commercially available HA antibodies applied to MCoTI-HA confirmed that the 
      conformation of peptide immunogens affects their reactivity. Thus, the production of 
      antibodies that recognize constrained epitopes may benefit from engraftment onto 
      scaffolds such as cyclotides. More broadly, this study validates that a prototypic 
      cyclotide, a member of a peptide family that has proven to be useful as drug design 
      scaffolds in many other studies, can efficiently reach a specific target in vivo.

TI  - The Glycoprotein 340's Scavenger Receptor Cysteine-Rich Domain Promotes Adhesion of 
      Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Contact Lens Polymers.

AB  - Contact lenses are biomaterials worn on the eye to correct refractive errors. 
      Bacterial adhesion and colonization of these lenses results in adverse events, such 
      as microbial keratitis. The adsorption of tear proteins to contact lens materials 
      enhances bacterial adhesion. Glycoprotein 340 (Gp340), a tear component, is known to 
      promote microbial colonization in the oral cavity; however, it has not been 
      investigated in any contact lens-related adverse event. Therefore, this study 
      examined the adsorption of Gp340 and its recombinantly expressed scavenger receptor 
      cysteine-rich (iSRCR(1)(Gp340)) domain on two common contact lens materials, 
      etafilcon A and lotrafilcon B, and the concomitant effects on the adherence of 
      clinical isolates of microbial keratitis causative agents, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      (PA6206; PA6294), and Staphylococcus aureus (SA38; USA300). Across all strains and 
      materials, iSRCR(1)(Gp340) enhanced adherence of bacteria in a dose-dependent 
      manner. However, (i)SRCR(1)(Gp340) did not modulate the lysozyme's or lactoferrin's 
      effects on bacterial adhesion to the contact lens. The Gp340 binding serine-rich 
      surface protein (SraP) significantly enhanced the binding of USA300 to 
      iSRCR(1)(Gp340)-coated lenses. In addition, iSRCR(1)(Gp340)-coated surfaces had 
      significantly diminished biofilms with the SraP mutant (ΔSraP), and there was a 
      further reduction in biofilms with the sortase A mutant (ΔSrtA), indicating the 
      likely involvement of additional surface proteins. Finally, the binding affinities 
      between iSRCR(1)(Gp340) and SraP were determined using surface plasmon resonance 
      (SPR), where the complete SraP binding region displayed nanomolar affinity, whereas 
      its smaller fragments adhered with micromolar affinities. This study concludes that 
      Gp340 and its SRCR domains play an important role in bacterial adhesion to the 
      contact lens.

AB  - Chronic pain is a common and often debilitating condition. Existing treatments are 
      either inefficacious or associated with a wide range of side effects. The progress 
      on developing safer and more effective analgesics has been slow, in large part due 
      to our limited understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying pain in 
      different diseases. Generation and propagation of action potentials is a central 
      component of pain sensation and voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(V)s) play a 
      critical role in this process. In particular, the Na(V) subtype 1.7, has emerged as 
      a promising universal target for the treatment of pain. Recently, a spider venom 
      peptide, μ-TRTX-Pn3a, was found to be a highly selective inhibitor of Na(V)1.7. 
      Here, we report the first recombinant expression method for Pn3a in a bacterial 
      host, which provides an inexpensive route to production. Furthermore, we have 
      developed a method for bio-conjugation of our recombinantly produced Pn3a via 
      sortase A-mediated ligation, providing avenues for further pre-clinical development. 
      We demonstrate how heterologous expression in bacteria enables facile isotope 
      labelling of Pn3a, which allowed us to study the membrane binding properties of the 
      peptide by high-resolution solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
      spectroscopy using a recently developed lipid nanodisc system. The heteronuclear NMR 
      data indicate that the C-terminal region of the peptide undergoes a conformational 
      change upon lipid binding. The membrane binding properties of Pn3a are further 
      validated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which revealed that Pn3a 
      binds to zwitterionic planar lipid bilayers with thermodynamics that are largely 
      driven by enthalpic contributions.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen related to a variety of 
      life-threatening infections but for which antimicrobial resistance is liming the 
      treatment options. We report here that myricetin, but not its glycosylated form, can 
      remarkably decrease the production of several S. aureus virulence factors, including 
      adhesion, biofilm formation, hemolysis and staphyloxanthin production, without 
      interfering with growth. Myricetin affects both surface proteins and secreted 
      proteins which indicate that its action is unrelated to inhibition of the agr quorum 
      sensing system. Analysis of virulence related gene expression and computational 
      simulations of pivotal proteins involved in pathogenesis demonstrate that myricetin 
      downregulates the saeR global regulator and interacts with sortase A and 
      α-hemolysin. Furthermore, Myr confers a significant degree of protection against 
      staphylococcal infection in the Galleria mellonella model. The present findings 
      reveal the potential of Myr as an alternative multi-target antivirulence candidate 
      to control S. aureus pathogenicity.

AB  - Double-knotted peptides identified in venoms and synthetic bivalent peptide 
      constructs targeting ion channels are emerging tools for the study of ion channel 
      pharmacology and physiology. These highly complex and disulfide-rich peptides 
      contain two individual cystine knots, each comprising six cysteines and three 
      disulfide bonds. Until now, native double-knotted peptides, such as Hi1a and DkTx, 
      have only been isolated from venom or produced recombinantly, whereas engineered 
      double-knotted peptides have successfully been produced through enzymatic ligation 
      using sortase A to form a seamless amide bond at the ligation site between two 
      knotted toxins, and by alkyne/azide click chemistry, joining two peptide knots via a 
      triazole linkage. To further pursue these double-knotted peptides as pharmacological 
      tools or probes for therapeutically relevant ion channels, we sought to identify a 
      robust methodology resulting in a high yield product that lends itself to rapid 
      production and facile mutational studies. In this study, we evaluated the ligation 
      efficiency of enzymatic (sortase A5°, butelase 1, wild-type OaAEP 1, C247A-OaAEP 1, 
      and peptiligase) and mild chemical approaches (α-ketoacid-hydroxylamine, KAHA) for 
      forming a native amide bond linking the toxins while maintaining the native 
      disulfide connectivity of each pre-folded peptide. We used two Na(V)1.7 inhibitors: 
      PaurTx3, a spider-derived gating modifier peptide, and KIIIA, a small cone 
      snail-derived pore blocker peptide, which have previously been shown to increase 
      affinity and inhibitory potency on hNa(V)1.7 when ligated together. Correctly folded 
      peptides were successfully ligated in varying yields, without disulfide bond 
      shuffling or reduction, with sortase A5° being the most efficient, resulting in 60% 
      ligation conversion within 15 min. In addition, electrophysiology studies 
      demonstrated that for these two peptides, the amino acid composition of the linker 
      did not affect the activity of the double-knotted peptides. This study demonstrates 
      the powerful application of enzymes in efficiently ligating complex disulfide-rich 
      peptides, paving the way for facile production of double-knotted peptides.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current project was to study the antimicrobial efficacy 
      of a newly developed irrigant, k21/E against E. faecalis biofilm. METHODS: Root 
      canals were instrumented and randomly divided into the following groups: irrigation 
      with saline, 6% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite), 6% NaOCl+2% CHX (Chlorhexidine), 2% 
      CHX, 0.5% k21/E (k21 - quaternary ammonium silane) and 1% k21/E. E. faecalis were 
      grown (3-days) (1×10(7)CFU mL(-1)), treated, and further cultured for 11-days. 
      Specimens were subjected to SEM, confocal and Raman analysis and macrophage vesicles 
      characterized along with effect of lipopolysaccharide treatment. 3T3 
      mouse-fibroblasts were cultured for alizarin-red with Sortase-A active sites and 
      Schrödinger docking was performed. TEM analysis of root dentin substrate with matrix 
      metalloproteinases profilometry was also included. A cytotoxic test analysis for 
      cell viability was measured by absorbance of human dental pulp cells after exposure 
      to different irrigant solutions for 24h. The test percentages have been highlighted 
      in Table 1. RESULTS: Among experimental groups, irrigation with 0.5% k21/E showed 
      phase separation revealing significant bacterial reduction and lower phenylalanine 
      1003cm(-1) and Amide III 1245cm(-1) intensities. Damage was observed on bacterial 
      cell membrane after use of k21/E. No difference in exosomes distribution between 
      control and 0.5%k21/E was observed with less TNFα (*p<0.05) and preferential binding 
      of SrtA. TEM images demonstrated integrated collagen fibers in control and 0.5%k21/E 
      specimens and inner bacterial membrane damage after k21/E treatment. The k21 groups 
      appeared to be biocompatible to the dental pulpal cells grown for 24h. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Current investigations highlight potential advantages of 0.5% k21/E as irrigation 
      solution for root canal disinfection.

AB  - Coronavirus vaccines that are highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants are 
      needed to control the current pandemic. We previously reported a receptor-binding 
      domain (RBD) sortase A-conjugated ferritin nanoparticle (RBD-scNP) vaccine that 
      induced neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and pre-emergent sarbecoviruses 
      and protected monkeys from SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 infection. Here, we demonstrate 
      SARS-CoV-2 RBD-scNP immunization induces potent neutralizing antibodies in non-human 
      primates (NHPs) against all eight SARS-CoV-2 variants tested including the Beta, 
      Delta, and Omicron variants. The Omicron variant was neutralized by RBD-scNP-induced 
      serum antibodies with a mean of 10.6-fold reduction of ID50 titers compared to 
      SARS-CoV-2 D614G. Immunization with RBD-scNPs protected NHPs from SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, 
      Beta, and Delta variant challenge, and protected mice from challenges of SARS-CoV-2 
      Beta variant and two other heterologous sarbecoviruses. These results demonstrate 
      the ability of RBD-scNPs to induce broad neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants and 
      to protect NHPs and mice from multiple different SARS-related viruses. Such a 
      vaccine could provide the needed immunity to slow the spread of and reduce disease 
      caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Delta and Omicron.

AB  - Light-induction of an anionic semiquinone (SQ) flavin radical in Drosophila 
      cryptochrome (dCRY) alters the dCRY conformation to promote binding and degradation 
      of the circadian clock protein Timeless (TIM). Specific peptide ligation with 
      sortase A attaches a nitroxide spin-probe to the dCRY C-terminal tail (CTT) while 
      avoiding deleterious side reactions. Pulse dipolar electron-spin resonance 
      spectroscopy from the CTT nitroxide to the SQ shows that flavin photoreduction 
      shifts the CTT ~1 nm and increases its motion, without causing full displacement 
      from the protein. dCRY engineered to form the neutral SQ serves as a dark-state 
      proxy to reveal that the CTT remains docked when the flavin ring is reduced but 
      uncharged. Substitutions of flavin-proximal His378 promote CTT undocking in the dark 
      or diminish undocking in the light, consistent with molecular dynamics simulations 
      and TIM degradation activity. The His378 variants inform on recognition motifs for 
      dCRY cellular turnover and strategies for developing optogenetic tools.

TI  - Modulation of Antigen Display on PapMV Nanoparticles Influences Its Immunogenicity.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines9010033 [doi]
LID - 33
AB  - BACKGROUND: The papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) vaccine platform is a rod-shaped 
      nanoparticle made of the recombinant PapMV coat protein (CP) self-assembled around a 
      noncoding single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) template. The PapMV nanoparticle induces 
      innate immunity through stimulation of the Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8. The 
      display of the vaccine antigen at the surface of the nanoparticle, associated with 
      the co-stimulation signal via TLR7/8, ensures a strong stimulation of the immune 
      response, which is ideal for the development of candidate vaccines. In this study, 
      we assess the impact of where the peptide antigen is fused, whether at the surface 
      or at the extremities of the nanoparticles, on the immune response directed to that 
      antigen. METHODS: Two different peptides from influenza A virus were used as model 
      antigens. The conserved M2e peptide, derived from the matrix protein 2 was chosen as 
      the B-cell epitope, and a peptide derived from the nucleocapsid was chosen as the 
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitope. These peptides were coupled at two different 
      positions on the PapMV CP, the N- (PapMV-N) or the C-terminus (PapMV-C), using the 
      transpeptidase activity of Sortase A (SrtA). The immune responses, both humoral and 
      CD8+ T-cell-mediated, directed to the peptide antigens in the two different fusion 
      contexts were analyzed and compared. The impact of coupling density at the surface 
      of the nanoparticle was also investigated. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that 
      coupling of the peptide antigens at the N-terminus (PapMV-N) of the PapMV CP led to 
      an enhanced immune response to the coupled peptide antigens as compared to coupling 
      to the C-terminus. The difference between the two vaccine platforms is linked to the 
      enhanced capacity of the PapMV-N vaccine platform to stimulate TLR7/8. We also 
      demonstrated that the strength of the immune response increases with the density of 
      coupling at the surface of the nanoparticles.

TI  - Design, Preparation, and Characterization of PNA-Based Hybridization Probes for 
      Affibody-Molecule-Mediated Pretargeting.
PG  - 1724-36
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00292 [doi]
AB  - In radioimmunotherapy, the contrast between tumor and normal tissue can be improved 
      by using a pretargeting strategy with a primary targeting agent, which is conjugated 
      to a recognition tag, and a secondary radiolabeled molecule binding specifically to 
      the recognition tag. The secondary molecule is injected after the targeting agent 
      has accumulated in the tumor and is designed to have a favorable biodistribution 
      profile, with fast clearance from blood and low uptake in normal tissues. In this 
      study, we have designed and evaluated two complementary peptide nucleic acid 
      (PNA)-based probes for specific and high-affinity association in vivo. An anti-HER2 
      Affibody-PNA chimera, Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1, was produced by a semisynthetic approach 
      using sortase A catalyzed ligation of a recombinantly produced Affibody molecule to 
      a PNA-based HP1-probe assembled using solid-phase chemistry. A complementary HP2 
      probe carrying a DOTA chelator and a tyrosine for dual radiolabeling was prepared by 
      solid-phase synthesis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and UV thermal melts 
      showed that the probes can hybridize to form a structured duplex with a very high 
      melting temperature (T(m)), both in HP1:HP2 and in Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1:HP2 (T(m) = 
      86-88 °C), and the high binding affinity between Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1 and HP2 was 
      confirmed in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based binding study. Following a 
      moderately fast association (1.7 × 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)), the dissociation of the 
      probes was extremely slow and <5% dissociation was observed after 17 h. The 
      equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) for Z(HER2:342)-SR-HP1:HP2 binding to HER2 
      was estimated by SPR to be 212 pM, suggesting that the conjugation to PNA does not 
      impair Affibody binding to HER2. The biodistribution profiles of (111)In- and 
      (125)I-labeled HP2 were measured in NMRI mice, showing very fast blood clearance 
      rates and low accumulation of radioactivity in kidneys and other organs. The 
      measured radioactivity in blood was 0.63 ± 0.15 and 0.41 ± 0.15%ID/g for (125)I- and 
      (111)In-HP2, respectively, at 1 h p.i., and at 4 h p.i., the kidney accumulation of 
      radioactivity was 0.17 ± 0.04%ID/g for (125)I-HP2 and 3.83 ± 0.39%ID/g for 
      (111)In-HP2. Taken together, the results suggest that a PNA-based system has 
      suitable biophysical and in vivo properties and is a promising approach for 
      pretargeting of Affibody molecules.

TI  - Immunization with Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor B, a major determinant in 
      nasal carriage, reduces nasal colonization in a murine model.
PG  - 2145-53
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a wide range of infections, including soft 
      tissue infections and potentially fatal bacteremias. The primary niche for S. aureus 
      in humans is the nares, and nasal carriage is a documented risk factor for 
      staphylococcal infection. Previous studies with rodent models of nasal colonization 
      have implicated capsule and teichoic acid as staphylococcal surface factors that 
      promote colonization. In this study, a mouse model of nasal colonization was 
      utilized to demonstrate that S. aureus mutants that lack clumping factor A, collagen 
      binding protein, fibronectin binding proteins A and B, polysaccharide intercellular 
      adhesin, or the accessory gene regulator colonized as well as wild-type strains 
      colonized. In contrast, mutants deficient in sortase A or clumping factor B (ClfB) 
      showed reduced nasal colonization. Mice immunized intranasally with killed S. aureus 
      cells showed reduced nasal colonization compared with control animals. Likewise, 
      mice that were immunized systemically or intranasally with a recombinant vaccine 
      composed of domain A of ClfB exhibited lower levels of colonization than control 
      animals exhibited. A ClfB monoclonal antibody (MAb) inhibited S. aureus binding to 
      mouse cytokeratin 10. Passive immunization of mice with this MAb resulted in reduced 
      nasal colonization compared with the colonization observed after immunization with 
      an isotype-matched control antibody. The mouse immunization studies demonstrate that 
      ClfB is an attractive component for inclusion in a vaccine to reduce S. aureus nasal 
      colonization in humans, which in turn may diminish the risk of staphylococcal 
      infection. As targets for vaccine development and antimicrobial intervention are 
      assessed, rodent nasal colonization models may be invaluable.

TI  - Increased Immunogenicity of Full-Length Protein Antigens through Sortase-Mediated 
      Coupling on the PapMV Vaccine Platform.
LID - 10.3390/vaccines7020049 [doi]
LID - 49
AB  - Background: Flexuous rod-shape nanoparticles-made of the coat protein of papaya 
      mosaic virus (PapMV)-provide a promising vaccine platform for the presentation of 
      viral antigens to immune cells. The PapMV nanoparticles can be combined with viral 
      antigens or covalently linked to them. The coupling to PapMV was shown to improve 
      the immune response triggered against peptide antigens (<39 amino acids) but it 
      remains to be tested if large proteins can be coupled to this platform and if the 
      coupling will lead to an immune response improvement. Methods: Two full-length 
      recombinant viral proteins, the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and the simian 
      immunodeficiency virus group-specific protein antigen (GAG) were coupled to PapMV 
      nanoparticles using sortase A. Mice were immunized with the nanoparticles coupled to 
      the antigens and the immune response directed to the antigens were analyzed by ELISA 
      and ELISPOT. Results: We showed the feasibility of coupling two different 
      full-length proteins (GAG and NP) to the nanoparticle. We also showed that the 
      coupling to PapMV nanoparticles improved significantly the humoral and the cytotoxic 
      T lymphocyte (CTL) immune response to the antigens. Conclusion: This proof of 
      concept demonstrates the versatility and the efficacy of the PapMV vaccine platform 
      in the design of vaccines against viral diseases.

TI  - Sortase-Mediated Ligation of Purely Artificial Building Blocks.
LID - 10.3390/polym10020151 [doi]
LID - 151
AB  - Sortase A (SrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus has been often used for ligating a 
      protein with other natural or synthetic compounds in recent years. Here we show that 
      SrtA-mediated ligation (SML) is universally applicable for the linkage of two purely 
      artificial building blocks. Silica nanoparticles (NPs), poly(ethylene glycol) and 
      poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) are chosen as synthetic building blocks. As a proof of 
      concept, NP⁻polymer, NP⁻NP, and polymer⁻polymer structures are formed by SrtA 
      catalysis. Therefore, the building blocks are equipped with the recognition sequence 
      needed for SrtA reaction-the conserved peptide LPETG-and a pentaglycine motif. The 
      successful formation of the reaction products is shown by means of transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of 
      flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The 
      sortase catalyzed linkage of artificial building blocks sets the stage for the 
      development of a new approach to link synthetic structures in cases where their 
      synthesis by established chemical methods is complicated.

TI  - Cyclic diGMP regulates production of sortase substrates of Clostridium difficile and 
      their surface exposure through ZmpI protease-mediated cleavage.

AB  - In Gram-positive pathogens, surface proteins may be covalently anchored to the 
      bacterial peptidoglycan by sortase, a cysteine transpeptidase enzyme. In contrast to 
      other Gram-positive bacteria, only one single sortase enzyme, SrtB, is conserved 
      between strains of Clostridium difficile. Sortase-mediated peptidase activity has 
      been reported in vitro, and seven potential substrates have been identified. Here, 
      we demonstrate the functionality of sortase in C. difficile. We identify two 
      sortase-anchored proteins, the putative adhesins CD2831 and CD3246, and determine 
      the cell wall anchor structure of CD2831. The C-terminal PPKTG sorting motif of 
      CD2831 is cleaved between the threonine and glycine residues, and the carboxyl group 
      of threonine is amide-linked to the side chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid 
      within the peptidoglycan peptide stem. We show that CD2831 protein levels are 
      elevated in the presence of high intracellular cyclic diGMP (c-diGMP) 
      concentrations, in agreement with the control of CD2831 expression by a 
      c-diGMP-dependent type II riboswitch. Low c-diGMP levels induce the release of 
      CD2831 and presumably CD3246 from the surface of cells. This regulation is mediated 
      by proteolytic cleavage of CD2831 and CD3246 by the zinc metalloprotease ZmpI, whose 
      expression is controlled by a type I c-diGMP riboswitch. These data reveal a novel 
      regulatory mechanism for expression of two sortase substrates by the secondary 
      messenger c-diGMP, on which surface anchoring is dependent.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus Panton-Valentine leukocidin is a pore-forming toxin targeting 
      the human C5a receptor (hC5aR), enabling this pathogen to battle the immune response 
      by destroying phagocytes through targeted lysis. The mechanisms that contribute to 
      rapid cell lysis are largely unexplored. Here, we show that cell lysis may be 
      enabled by a process of toxins targeting receptor clusters and present indirect 
      evidence for receptor "recycling" that allows multiple toxin pores to be formed 
      close together. With the use of live cell single-molecule super-resolution imaging, 
      Förster resonance energy transfer and nanoscale total internal reflection 
      fluorescence colocalization microscopy, we visualized toxin pore formation in the 
      presence of its natural docking ligand. We demonstrate disassociation of hC5aR from 
      toxin complexes and simultaneous binding of new ligands. This effect may free mobile 
      receptors to amplify hyperinflammatory reactions in early stages of microbial 
      infections and have implications for several other similar bicomponent toxins and 
      the design of new antibiotics.-Haapasalo, K., Wollman, A. J. M., de Haas, C. J. C.,

TI  - Selection and characterization of a SpaCBA pilus-secreting food-grade derivative of 
      Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG.
PG  - 1123-1131
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-11051-7 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have established the functional properties of Lacticaseibacillus 
      rhamnosus GG, previously known as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, marketed worldwide as 
      a probiotic. The extraordinary capacity of L. rhamnosus GG to bind to human mucus 
      and influence the immune system especially stand out. Earlier, we have shown the key 
      role of its SpaCBA sortase-dependent pili encoded by the spaCBA-srtC1 gene cluster 
      herein. These heterotrimeric pili consist of a shaft pilin SpaA, a basal pilin SpaB, 
      and tip pilin SpaC that contains a mucus-binding domain. Here, we set out to 
      characterize a food-grade non-GMO mutant of L. rhamnosus GG, strain PA11, which 
      secretes its pilins, rather than coupling them to the cell surface, due to a defect 
      in the housekeeping sortase A. The sortase-negative strain PA11 was extensively 
      characterized using functional genomics and biochemical approaches and found to 
      secrete the SpaCBA pili into the supernatant. Given the functional importance and 
      uniqueness of the mucus-binding pili of L. rhamnosus GG, strain PA11 offers novel 
      opportunities towards the characterization and further therapeutic application of 
      SpaCBA pili and their low-cost, large-scale production. KEY POINTS: •Creation of 
      pilus-secreting mutant (PA11) of the key probiotic LGG. •Strain PA11 is defective in 
      a functional housekeeping sortase SrtA. •Strain PA11 opens novel biotherapeutic 
      application avenues. Graphical abstract.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Strategies to improve the responsiveness of programmed death-1 
      (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) checkpoint blockade therapy remain an 
      essential topic in cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we developed a new 
      radiolabeled nanobody-based imaging probe (99m)Tc-MY1523 targeting PD-L1 for the 
      enhanced therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy by the guidance of 
      (99m)Tc-MY1523 SPECT/CT imaging. METHODS: The binding affinity and specificity of 
      nanobody MY1523 were measured in vitro. MY1523 was radiolabeled with (99m)Tc by a 
      site-specific transpeptidation of Sortase-A, and the biodistribution and single 
      photon emission CT (SPECT)/CT were performed in mice bearing different tumors. We 
      used interferon-γ (IFN-γ) as an intervention means to establish animal models with 
      different levels of PD-L1 expression, then investigated the ability of 
      (99m)Tc-MY1523 SPECT/CT for the in vivo non-invasive measurement of PD-L1 expression 
      in tumors. Finally, the PD-L1 blockade immunotherapies guided by (99m)Tc-MY1523 
      SPECT/CT were carried out in MC-38, A20, and 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse models, 
      followed by the testing of tumor infiltration T cells. RESULTS: MY1523 exhibited a 
      high binding affinity and specificity to PD-L1 and had no competitive binding with 
      the therapeutic antibody. (99m)Tc-MY1523 was prepared with high specific activity 
      and radiochemical purity. It was found that tumor PD-L1 expression was dynamically 
      upregulated by IFN-γ intervention in MC-38, A20, and 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse models, 
      as indicated by (99m)Tc-MY1523 SPECT/CT. The PD-L1 blockade therapy initiated during 
      the therapeutic time window determined by (99m)Tc-MY1523 SPECT/CT imaging 
      significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy in all animal models, while the 
      tumor growth was effectively suppressed, and the survival time of mice was evidently 
      prolonged. A correlation between dynamically upregulated PD-L1 expression and 
      improved PD-L1 blockade therapy effectiveness was revealed, and the markedly 
      increased infiltration of effector T cells into tumors was verified after the 
      imaging-guided therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that (99m)Tc-MY1523 
      SPECT/CT allowed a real-time, quantitative and dynamic mapping of PD-L1 expression 
      in vivo, and the imaging-guided PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy significantly enhanced 
      the therapeutic efficacy. This strategy merits translation into clinical practice 
      for the better management of combination therapies with radiotherapy or 
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Structure-Function Characterization of Streptococcus intermedius Surface Antigen 
      Pas.

LID - e00175-21
AB  - Streptococcus intermedius, an oral commensal bacterium, is found at various sites, 
      including subgingival dental plaque, purulent infections, and cystic fibrosis lungs. 
      Oral streptococci utilize proteins on their surface to adhere to tissues and/or 
      surfaces localizing the bacteria, which subsequently leads to the development of 
      biofilms, colonization, and infection. Among the 19 genomically annotated cell 
      wall-attached surface proteins on S. intermedius, Pas is an adhesin that belongs to 
      the antigen I/II (AgI/II) family. Here, we have structurally and functionally 
      characterized Pas, particularly focusing on its microbial-host as well as 
      microbial-microbial interactions. The crystal structures of V(Pas) and C(123)(Pas) 
      show high similarity with AgI/II of Streptococcus mutans. V(Pas) hosts a conserved 
      metal binding site, and likewise, the C(123)(Pas) structure retains its conserved 
      metal binding sites and isopeptide bonds within its three DEv-IgG domains. Pas 
      interacts with nanomolar affinity to lung alveolar glycoprotein 340 (Gp340), its 
      scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains (SRCRs), and with fibrinogen. Both Candida 
      albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the opportunistic pathogens that cohabitate 
      with S. intermedius in the lungs of CFTR patients were studied in dual-species 
      biofilm studies. The Pas-deficient mutant (Δpas) displayed significant reduction in 
      dual-biofilm formation with C. albicans. In similar studies with P. aeruginosa, Pas 
      did not mediate the biofilm formation with either the acute isolate (PAO1) or the 
      chronic isolate (FRD1). However, the sortase A-deficient mutant (ΔsrtA) displayed 
      reduced biofilm formation with both C. albicans and P. aeruginosa FRD1. Taken 
      together, our findings highlight the role of Pas in both microbial-host and 
      interkingdom interactions and expose its potential role in disease outcomes. 
      IMPORTANCE Streptococcus intermedius, an oral commensal bacterium, has been 
      clinically observed in subgingival dental plaque, purulent infections, and cystic 
      fibrosis lungs. In this study, we have (i) determined the crystal structure of the V 
      and C regions of Pas; (ii) shown that its surface protein Pas adheres to fibrinogen, 
      which could potentially ferry the microbe through the bloodstream from the oral 
      cavity; (iii) characterized Pas's high-affinity adherence to lung alveolar protein 
      Gp340 that could fixate the microbe on lung epithelial cells; and (iv) most 
      importantly, shown that these surface proteins on the oral commensal S. intermedius 
      enhance biofilms of known pathogens Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful and indispensable tool in medical 
      research, clinical diagnosis, and patient care due to its high spatial resolution 
      and non-limited penetration depth. The simultaneous use of positive and negative MRI 
      imaging that employs the same contrast agents will significantly improve detection 
      accuracy. Here we report the development of functional multimodal iron oxide 
      nanoparticles for targeted MRI of atherothrombosis using a combination of chemical 
      and biological conjugation techniques. Monodisperse, water-soluble and biocompatible 
      ultra-small magnetic dual contrast iron oxide nanoparticles (DCIONs) were generated 
      using a high-temperature co-precipitation route and appeared to be efficient 
      positive and negative dual contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. Using a 
      unique chemo-enzymatic approach involving copper-free click chemistry and 
      Staphylococcus aureus sortase A enzyme conjugation, DCIONs were functionalized with 
      single-chain antibodies (scFv) directed against activated platelets for targeting 
      purposes. The DCIONs were also labelled with fluorescent molecules to allow for 
      optical imaging. The antigen binding activity of the scFv was retained and resulted 
      in the successful targeting of contrast agents to thrombosis as demonstrated in a 
      range of in vitro and in vivo experiments. T(1)- and T(2)-weighted MRI of thrombi 
      was recorded and demonstrated the great potential of dual T(1)/T(2) contrast iron 
      oxide particles in imaging of cardiovascular disease.

TI  - RecT Recombinase Expression Enables Efficient Gene Editing in Enterococcus spp.
PG  - e0084421

LID - e00844-21
AB  - Enterococcus faecium is a ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterium that has been recovered 
      from the environment, food, and microbiota of mammals. Commensal strains of E. 
      faecium can confer beneficial effects on host physiology and immunity, but 
      antibiotic usage has afforded antibiotic-resistant and pathogenic isolates from 
      livestock and humans. However, the dissection of E. faecium functions and mechanisms 
      has been restricted by inefficient gene-editing methods. To address these 
      limitations, here, we report that the expression of E. faecium RecT recombinase 
      significantly improves the efficiency of recombineering technologies in both 
      commensal and antibiotic-resistant strains of E. faecium and other Enterococcus 
      species such as E. durans and E. hirae. Notably, the expression of RecT in 
      combination with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR)-Cas9 and guide RNAs (gRNAs) enabled highly efficient scarless 
      single-stranded DNA recombineering to generate specific gene-editing mutants in E. 
      faecium. Moreover, we demonstrate that E. faecium RecT expression facilitated 
      chromosomal insertions of double-stranded DNA templates encoding 
      antibiotic-selectable markers to generate gene deletion mutants. As a further proof 
      of principle, we use CRISPR-Cas9-mediated recombineering to knock out both sortase A 
      genes in E. faecium for downstream functional characterization. The general 
      RecT-mediated recombineering methods described here should significantly enhance 
      genetic studies of E. faecium and other closely related species for functional and 
      mechanistic studies. IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecium is widely recognized as an 
      emerging public health threat with the rise of drug resistance and nosocomial 
      infections. Nevertheless, commensal Enterococcus strains possess beneficial health 
      functions in mammals to upregulate host immunity and prevent microbial infections. 
      This functional dichotomy of Enterococcus species and strains highlights the need 
      for in-depth studies to discover and characterize the genetic components underlying 
      its diverse activities. However, current genetic engineering methods in E. faecium 
      still require passive homologous recombination from plasmid DNA. This involves the 
      successful cloning of multiple homologous fragments into a plasmid, introducing the 
      plasmid into E. faecium, and screening for double-crossover events that can 
      collectively take up to multiple weeks to perform. To alleviate these challenges, we 
      show that RecT recombinase enables the rapid and efficient integration of mutagenic 
      DNA templates to generate substitutions, deletions, and insertions in the genomic 
      DNA of E. faecium. These improved recombineering methods should facilitate 
      functional and mechanistic studies of Enterococcus.

AB  - Most of Gram-positive bacteria anchor surface proteins to the peptidoglycan cell 
      wall by sortase, a cysteine transpeptidase that targets proteins displaying a cell 
      wall sorting signal. Unlike other bacteria, Clostridium difficile, the major human 
      pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, has only a single 
      functional sortase (SrtB). Sortase's vital importance in bacterial virulence has 
      been long recognized, and C. difficile sortase B (Cd-SrtB) has become an attractive 
      therapeutic target for managing C. difficile infection. A better understanding of 
      the molecular activity of Cd-SrtB may help spur the development of effective agents 
      against C. difficile infection. In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis, 
      biochemical and biophysical tools, LC-MS/MS, and crystallographic analyses, we 
      identified key residues essential for Cd-SrtB catalysis and substrate recognition. 
      To the best of our knowledge, we report the first evidence that a conserved serine 
      residue near the active site participates in the catalytic activity of Cd-SrtB and 
      also SrtB from Staphylococcus aureus The serine residue indispensable for SrtB 
      activity may be involved in stabilizing a thioacyl-enzyme intermediate because it is 
      neither a nucleophilic residue nor a substrate-interacting residue, based on the 
      LC-MS/MS data and available structural models of SrtB-substrate complexes. 
      Furthermore, we also demonstrated that residues 163-168 located on the β6/β7 loop of 
      Cd-SrtB dominate specific recognition of the peptide substrate PPKTG. The results of 
      this work reveal key residues with roles in catalysis and substrate specificity of 
      Cd-SrtB.

TI  - Effect of Propolis Nanoparticles against Enterococcus faecalis Biofilm in the Root 
      Canal.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26030715 [doi]
LID - 715
AB  - To determine the antibacterial effect of propolis nanoparticles (PNs) as an 
      endodontic irrigant against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm inside the endodontic root 
      canal system. Two-hundred-ten extracted human teeth were sectioned to obtain 6 mm of 
      the middle third of the root. The root canal was enlarged to an internal diameter of 
      0.9 mm. The specimens were inoculated with E. faecalis for 21 days. Following this, 
      specimens were randomly divided into seven groups, with 30 dentinal blocks in each 
      group including: group I-saline; group II-propolis 100 µg/mL; group III-propolis 300 
      µg/mL; group IV-propolis nanoparticle 100 µg/mL; group V-propolis nanoparticle 
      300µg/mL; group VI-6% sodium hypochlorite; group VII-2% chlorhexidine. Dentin 
      shavings were collected at 200 and 400 μm depths, and total numbers of CFUs were 
      determined at the end of one, five, and ten minutes. The non-parametric 
      Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the differences in 
      reduction in CFUs between all groups, and probability values of p < 0.05 were set as 
      the reference for statistically significant results. The antibacterial effect of PNs 
      as an endodontic irrigant was also assessed against E. faecalis isolates from 
      patients with failed root canal treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 
      confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were also performed after exposure to PNs. 
      A Raman spectroscope, equipped with a Leica microscope and lenses with curve-fitting 
      Raman software, was used for analysis. The molecular interactions between bioactive 
      compounds of propolis (Pinocembrin, Kaempferol, and Quercetin) and the proteins 
      Sortase A and β-galactosidase were also understood by computational molecular 
      docking studies. PN300 was significantly more effective in reducing CFUs compared to 
      all other groups (p < 0.05) except 6% NaOCl and 2% CHX (p > 0.05) at all time 
      intervals and both depths. At five minutes, 6% NaOCl and 2% CHX were the most 
      effective in reducing CFUs (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found 
      between PN300, 6% NaOCl, and 2% CHX at 10 min (p > 0.05). SEM images also showed the 
      maximum reduction in E. faecalis with PN300, 6% NaOCl, and 2% CHX at five and ten 
      minutes. CLSM images showed the number of dead cells in dentin were highest with 
      PN300 compared to PN100 and saline. There was a reduction in the 484 cm(-1) band and 
      an increase in the 870 cm(-1) band in the PN300 group. The detailed observations of 
      the docking poses of bioactive compounds and their interactions with key residues of 
      the binding site in all the three docking protocols revealed that the interactions 
      were consistent with reasonable docking and IFD docking scores. PN300 was equally as 
      effective as 6% NaOCl and 2% CHX in reducing the E. faecalis biofilms.

TI  - Anti-Adhesion and Antibiofilm Activity of Eruca sativa Miller Extract Targeting Cell 
      Adhesion Proteins of Food-Borne Bacteria as a Potential Mechanism: Combined In 
      Vitro-In Silico Approach.
LID - 10.3390/plants11050610 [doi]
LID - 610
AB  - Bacterial cells have the ability to form biofilm onto the surfaces of food matrixes 
      and on food processing equipment, leading to a source of food contamination posing 
      serious health implications. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the effect of 
      Eruca sativa Miller (E. sativa) crude extract against biofilms of food-borne 
      bacteria along with in silico approaches to investigate adhesion proteins 
      responsible for biofilm activity against the identified phytochemicals. The 
      antibacterial potential of crude extract was evaluated using agar well diffusion 
      technique and combinations of light and scanning electron microscopy to assess the 
      efficacy of crude extract against the developed biofilms. Our results showed that 
      crude extract of E. sativa was active against all tested food-borne bacteria, 
      exhibiting a rapid kinetics of killing bacteria in a time-dependent manner. MIC and 
      MBC values of E. sativa crude extract were found to be ranging from 125 to 500 µg/mL 
      and 250 to 1000 µg/mL respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of developed biofilm by 
      E sativa was found to be ranging from 58.68% to 73.45% for all the tested strains. 
      The crude extract also reduced the viability of bacterial cells within biofilms and 
      amount of EPS (ranging 59.73-82.77%) in the biofilm matrix. Additionally, the 
      microscopic images also revealed significant disruption in the structure of 
      biofilms. A molecular docking analysis of E. sativa phytochemicals showed 
      interaction with active site of adhesion proteins Sortase A, EspA, OprD, and type IV 
      b pilin of S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. enterica ser. typhi, 
      respectively. Thus, our findings represent the first demonstration of E. sativa 
      crude extract's bioactivity and potency against food-borne bacteria in their 
      planktonic forms, as well as against the developed biofilms. Therefore, a possible 
      mechanistic approach for inhibition of biofilm via targeting adhesion proteins can 
      be explored further to target biofilm producing food-borne bacterial pathogens.

      Staphylococcus aureus CF Clinical Isolates.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24061151 [doi]
LID - 1151
AB  - The justification for the use of herbal supplements with Pulmonaria officinalis L. 
      extract (POE) in the case of staphylococcal lung colonization/infections 
      characteristic for cystic fibrosis (CF), was examined in vitro. The impact of POE 
      phenolic-rich fraction on the virulence attributes of CF-associated Staphylococcus 
      aureus (S. aureus) clinical strains has been assessed, including pathogen adhesion, 
      biofilm formation on native and protein-conditioned surfaces (mucin, elastin), 
      mature biofilm eradication, staphylococcal protein A expression, α-toxin release, 
      and S. a. adhesion to A549 cells. Cytotoxicity of the extract to lung epithelial 
      cells was also investigated. It was found that POE has bacteriostatic effects at MIC 
      1⁻2 mg/mL, recognized as of limited efficacy, but at MIC/subMICs it targeted 
      virulence not viability. It usually decreased S. aureus adhesion and less frequently 
      inhibited biofilm formation on native and protein-conditioned surfaces. Observed 
      effect seems to be related to significant reduction by POE of sortase A activity. 
      However, in some cases POE favored the creation of biofilm by staphylococci and S. 
      aureus adhesion to the lung epithelium was not limited. On the other side POE caused 
      significant decrease of S. a. α-toxin synthesis and slightly weakened the expression 
      of SpA. When used at supraMICs POE eradicated mature biofilm, but in some cases with 
      unsatisfying outcomes. Promisingly, POE has been recognized as a safe product, with 
      no cytotoxicity up to 4 mg/mL. These results reflect the positive, negative or 
      neutral anti-staphylococcal properties of POE. It seems that POE may be beneficial 
      as a prophylactic, but not as a therapeutic or supportive agent in the area of 
      CF-integrative medicine. However, introduction the official recommendations needs 
      further in vivo studies.

TI  - Identification of Staphylococcus aureus Cellular Pathways Affected by the Stilbenoid 
      Lead Drug SK-03-92 Using a Microarray.

AB  - The mechanism of action for a new lead stilbene compound coded SK-03-92 with 
      bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is 
      unknown. To gain insight into the killing process, transcriptional profiling was 
      performed on SK-03-92 treated vs. untreated S. aureus. Fourteen genes were 
      upregulated and 38 genes downregulated by SK-03-92 treatment. Genes involved in 
      sortase A production, protein metabolism, and transcriptional regulation were 
      upregulated, whereas genes encoding transporters, purine synthesis proteins, and a 
      putative two-component system (SACOL2360 (MW2284) and SACOL2361 (MW2285)) were 
      downregulated by SK-03-92 treatment. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction analyses validated upregulation of srtA and tdk as well as downregulation 
      of the MW2284/MW2285 and purine biosynthesis genes in the drug-treated population. A 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of MW2284 and MW2285 
      mutants compared to wild-type cells demonstrated that the srtA gene was upregulated 
      by both putative two-component regulatory gene mutants compared to the wild-type 
      strain. Using a transcription profiling technique, we have identified several 
      cellular pathways regulated by SK-03-92 treatment, including a putative 
      two-component system that may regulate srtA and other genes that could be tied to 
      the SK-03-92 mechanism of action, biofilm formation, and drug persisters.
